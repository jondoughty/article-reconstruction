    "article_text": "Unless you’ve been gagged, handcuffed, lobotomized and hiding in a cave for the past year, you have heard about the O.J. Simpson case. The Mustang Daily, through a wise editorial decision reached through deep deliberation, debate, and being heartily sick of the whole thing by the first week of jury selection, has had very light coverage of the proceedings. But now that the jury has decided that OJ. is absolutely, 100 percent not guilty, it is time to talk about it. Did you breathe a sigh of relief when he was acquitted? Did you jump up, grab your shotgun and mutter ^at you were going to get him yourself? Were you dissappointed because there wont be any riots? You must have some opinion, and we want to know about it. Can you believe the coverage of his return home? How many of the jurors do you think will write books? Will Robert Shapiro end up doing commercials for the Hair Club for Men? How much credit in their “Oh God, we feel so guilty about slavery” account did the black community use up in this fiasco? Any aspect of this festival of madness is open to your inspection. So fire up your computer (or typewriter if you’re Paleolithic) and write up your opinions (double-spaced, s’il vous plait) with some degree of conciseness. Add your name, major, year and phone number and drop it off or mail it to the Daily at Graphic Arts Bldg. #226, fai: to 756-6784, or e-mail it to the address below. And we’ll thank you not to keep your opinions to yourself. -D.P. Editor, Re: Ben Schein’s “Accomplishment, not affirmative action” on Sept. 28 Although I was slightly coerced by my English teacher to write a response to Ben Schein’s article, I too am unsatisfied with his presented “arguments.” What is the point of Ben’s argument regarding people’s inequalities? Is he suggesting that if you are not naturally brilliant, it is the “minority’s” obligation to negate education and live a life based on athletic ability? And in the same paragraph he states, “If none of us had our own separate gifts and talents, we would not be able to tell each other apart.” How do you tell people apart in your everyday life? I use such criteria as personality and physical api>earance. This statement is too vague to effectively support his argument My second and last rebuttal concerns Ben Schein’s hard work to increase his SAT score. How many financially challenged families have the money to send their child to a workshop such as the Princeton Review? Not too many. Ben Schein ignores the realization that not everybody can participate in specialized workshops to improve their SAT scores. It is important to be sensitive and considerate when judging other people and the situation they are in. Oddly enough, there are students who want to succeed in their stupes,, but their surrounding environment prevents them from doing so. For example, what if you go to school in a poor community and getting good grades includes getting beat up after school each day because your classmates feel you are too studious. Education quickly develops a bitter taste. I agree with Ben Schein’s view that people should be accepted an merit, not ethnicity, but it is important to be considerate of other people’s backgrounds. Unfortunately some students abuse the system, but we must not label every minority student as a lazy parasite. In closing, it is my advice to Ben Schein to, for starters, calm down and then rethink his arguments. In the words of my English teacher, if you are willing to give your opinion, you should also be willing to accept honest criticism. Once again, in a feeble attempt to raise oontroveny and broaden the minds of its readers, the Mustang Daily has chosen yet another vmdereducated, irrational columnist to meet the deadlines of the Opinion section. Brian Johnson’s Monday column on atheism only furthered my theory of the growing number of fanatics religion has created. I am not opposed to religion, nor am I opposed to speaking your mind, but I am opposed to poor attempts to rsuse consciousness on our campus as Johnson did in his column. Being an atheist goes far beyond anarchy and lack of moral judgment as Johnson assumes in his column. It is based on belief in yourself. 'The reason for atheism is largely due to pressure to conform to the numerous restrictions laid out by the church. ha I sat there at 10 o’clock in the morning sipping my Yes, Simpson is a national celebrity and there has been a oj.
