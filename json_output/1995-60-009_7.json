    "article_text": "Unless you’ve been gagged, handcuffed, lobotomized and hiding in a cave for the past year, you have heard about the O.J. Simpson case. The Mustang Daily, through a wise editorial decision reached through deep deliberation, debate, and being heartily sick of the whole thing by the first week of jury selection, has had very light coverage of the proceedings. But now that the jury has decided that OJ. is absolutely, 100 percent not guilty, it is time to talk about it. Did you breathe a sigh of relief when he was acquitted? Did you jump up, grab your shotgun and mutter ^at you were going to get him yourself? Were you dissappointed because there wont be any riots? You must have some opinion, and we want to know about it. Can you believe the coverage of his return home? How many of the jurors do you think will write books? Will Robert Shapiro end up doing commercials for the Hair Club for Men? How much credit in their “Oh God, we feel so guilty about slavery” account did the black community use up in this fiasco? Any aspect of this festival of madness is open to your inspection. So fire up your computer (or typewriter if you’re Paleolithic) and write up your opinions (double-spaced, s’il vous plait) with some degree of conciseness. Add your name, major, year and phone number and drop it off or mail it to the Daily at Graphic Arts Bldg. #226, fai: to 756-6784, or e-mail it to the address below. And we’ll thank you not to keep your opinions to yourself. -D.P.",
