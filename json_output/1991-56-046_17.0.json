    "article_text": "I voted no on the athletic referendum, though at the time I was divided on the issue. I value the sports program at Cal Poly; track and field, volleyball — awesome playing, committed athletes. When the referendum passed, 1 was relieved and somewhat pleased. But here lies my reserved portion that put an X in the “no” box on Nov. 21. This referendum was not presented in formal, unbiased wi’iting to the student body. The fees would rise gradually and effect primarily those who had no vote (I thought we needed the money now). A member of the IRA board was removed mysteriously prior to initialization of the referendum committee apparently on account of his viewpoint against the referendum. Athletics did a tremendous job of campaigning for the referendum at the final football game while a letter was circulated to math, science and engineering faculty instructing them not to sway students not to vote against the referendum. These incidents tell me I was not trusted in any way to make a decision for the institution I attend, support and admire. This was a mock election, a study in hidden agenda and manipulation. I did not desire in any way for those families of athletic faculty to lose what they had. I wanted to vote for them but I could not. I was forced to protest this mockery of the students. But at the end, thank you President Baker for this instructional related activity in political science. Please practice these techniques on behalf of our library fee increase.",
