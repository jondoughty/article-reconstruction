    "article_text": "VITORIA, Spain (AP) — A bus carrying tourists from Lisbon to Paris careened off a road in northern Spain on Saturday, killing 17 people and injuring 31 others, authorities said. A survivor said the driver had fallen asleep. The bus, carrying 46 passengers, plowed through a safety barrier and into a ravine outside the northern Spanish town of Vitoria, police said. The dead, including a 5-year-old girl, were Portuguese, one of them a Portuguese-born French citizen. Of the injured, 17 remained hospitalized late Saturday. Police said one New Zealander, two French nationals and two Dutch citizens were among those hospitalized. Portugal’s news agency Lusa quoted passenger Maria de Nazare Carvalho, 57, as saying the driver apparently fell asleep at the wheel. She said she had suggested he allow the co-driver to take over. The fall of the bus was broken by a load lost by a truck that had overturned at the same spot earlier in the week, news reports said.",
