    "article_text": "Santa Barbara businessman Michael Huffington announced Wednesday that he is running for the new District 22 congressional seat, giving voters “a choice between status quo and change.” Huffington will be running against fellow Republican Rep. Robert Lagomarsino for the new seat, which covers Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. After making his announcement on the San Luis Obispo Courthouse steps, Huffington, who has never run for office, said he wants to help bring about a “new national order.” Citing a system that he said was pushing people onto welfare and into crime, Huffington said the country is in a mess that only can be changed with a different group of people in Congress. “We need people different from the ones who have sat in Congress decade after decade, until they have forgotten why they went there in the first place,” Huffington said. Huffington, who said he supports term limits, called the present Congress a club, “and the armchairs of the club are deep and comfortable. “The only way we’re going to get rules that are fair is to change the players,” Huffington added. Huffington, who is considered a moderate Republican, called himself a “conservative with a conscience.” “I believe in lower taxes and fiscal responsibility,” he said. “I also believe in help for those who truly need it.” Huffington also said he is pro-choice on the question of abortion. Huffington said he and his wife are personally opposed to abortion, but “we also believe very strongly in every woman’s right to :h(X)se and in the freedom to keep life’s private decisions private.” James Lindholm, a Cal Poly political science graduate, said he found some of the things Huffington said interesting. Lindholm is one of several political science students who was to take part in a question-and-answer session with Huffington Thursday after-n{H)n at Cal Poly. The student conference was to be taped and is part of Huffington’s campaign. Lindholm said he planned to talk to Huffington about education and, especially, the environment. “Offshore drilling is obviously an issue for him,” Lindholm said. “He could play a big role in preventing it.” Kelly Kafel, a political science senior who also attended Huffington’s announcement, said she found the idea of a mcxlerate Republican a bit confusing. She said she felt HufTmgton’s belief in the sanctity of life and his pro-choice stance was a mixing of moral and legal issues. “I thought church and state were two different things,” Kafel said. “In one sentence he combined them both.”",
