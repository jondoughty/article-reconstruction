    "article_text": "BETHESDA, Md. (AP) — There is no compelling scientific evidence that silicone gel breast implants can cause disease, even if the devices rupture, but more study is needed, experts said Thursday. A Food and Drug Administration panel considering the safety of breast implants sought to reassure women with the devices. It said reports that leaking silicone from the implants cause a variety of immunological disorders are not conclusive. “There have been many allegations, but no one has accepted them as statistically valid,” said Dr. Elizabeth Connell, an Emory University professor who is chairman of the FDA advisory panel. “We don’t feel a clear cause-and-effect relationship has been established,” she said. DETROIT (AP) — Chrysler Corp. is recalling about 19,000 1992-model cars and minivans to replace a potentially defective steering assembly bolt. Company spokesman James Kenyon said Thursday no accidents or injuries have been attributed to the problem. But if the bolt breaks, steering control could be lost, he said. Affected vehicles include Plymouth Sundance and Acclaim; Dodge Daytona, Shadow, Dynasty and Spirit; Chrysler LeBaron, Imperial and New \"Vbrker and some minivans. The recall covers vehicles built in late October. Owners will be notified by mail and repairs will be performed for free.
