Johnson\u2019s manager said it was a mistake or sabotage. Dr. Gustavo Tuccimei, president of the Italian Sports Doctors Association and a member of the medical commission, said the IOC executive board was given the test result late Monday night and was to decide Tuesday what action to take. \u2019\u2019The only thing we can say at this stage is that it is a tragedy, a mistake or a sabotage,\u201d Johnson\u2019s manager, Larry Heidebrecht, said. \u201cUp to five days before the race, Ben was in perfect condition. Something has happened in those days. \u201dWe do not know what happened and how it happened, but apparently somebody has sabotaged Ben and we will find out who it was and how it was done.\u201d Johnson won his long-awaited showdown with American rival Carl Lewis on Saturday in an astonishing 9.79 seconds, four-hundredths of a second under his own world record set at the 1987 world championships in Rome. Lewis was second in an American-record 9.92 seconds. If Johnson is disqualified, it could open the way for Lewis to be awarded the gold medal, reviving his bid to win an unprecedented four gold medals in two successive Olympics.",
