The program Katherine is on was developed by internationally known physician Glen Doman, founder of the Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential in Philadelphia. “He takes the most hurt kids that others turn away. He takes the kids nobody will give any hope to,” Jean said. Jean said the bottom line of the program is to re-create the experiences of a well child. Most of Katherine’s current patterning is aimed at teaching her how to crawl. For this, three volunteers work her arms and legs and turn her head to simulate crawling movements. Jean needs three volunteers. eight times a day, seven days a week to pattern Katherine. She said that is why she moved from Los Angeles to San Luis Obispo four years ago. “I moved here because of the community support,” she said. Jean has about nine volunteers that are Cal Poly students. “The student volunteers I have now have been with me a long time. They spend hours in here in spite of what else they may be doing. It’s a shame they can’t get class credit for it, but it’s a credi\"; to them as human beings.” Bob George, a computer science senior, said, “I didn’t dj this for any class. I can help and learn at the same time. What could be better?” he said. “It’s the best form of therapy during finals week — just to spend time with Katherine and Jean away from school.” George carries a full load at Cal Poly, works two jobs and spends eight hours a week with Katherine. “It’s hard to find anyone more in need of help or any child more injured,” he said. George said that when he first met Katherine, she didn’t seem like a 4-year-old because she didn’t communicate her feelings. “But now she seems like a 7-year-old because she’s really strong-willed,” he said. Last January, Jean approached all of Cal Poly’s department heads with an informational packet about Katherine’s patterning and a proposal that they give class credit for lab hours doing her therapy. Patterning therapy for Katherine Blackburn requires three voiunteers, eight times a day, seven days a week. This exercise aims to simulate for Katherine the typical movements of a “well\" child. “The only person who even called me back was the (former) computer science department head,” she said. Physical education professor Bob Meyers offered lab credit for working with Katherine last year. He called the patterning an excellent opportunity for students. “It’s much more than hands-on physical therapy. It teaches “I admire her so much just for what she’s been through and how hard she tries. It’s a lot harder than anything we can liken it to.” Jean Blackburn says she has no regrets about devoting her life to Katherine’s therapy. If someone you love gets hurt, she says, “you’re going to help them. \\bu can’t just hand them over.\" you to understand the gift of giving. It’s something that touches your life. It’s something you will never forget as long as you live. They (students) were profoundly impressed by the love and dedication of the mother. They could see the heart and initiative the child showed in her limited way,” he said. Ann Morgan is in charge of setting up internships for human development majors. She said that working with Katherine is not appropriate as an internship because her students don’t have enough of a physiological background. She said the work could be done as a senior project with the proper research. Tim Cardana, an ornamental horticulture senior, has been working with Katherine for almost a year. “Most of the volunteers are in majors that have nothing to do with this (therapy). It seems ridiculous that they (physical education and human development majors) are not involved. I’m disappointed.” Cardana said he found out about Katherine when he went into the Placement Center to look for a job. However, after watching the video about her, he said he just wanted to be a part of it so much that he volunteered his time. “When she laughs, that makes it all worthwhile for me. Her spirit is really great,” he said. James Long, an electrical engineering senior, said he feels students have a lot to gain from working with Katherine. “Here you’re working with a child, and you can almost see different parts of the brain working,” he said. Rebecca Owen, an English junior, has been volunteering — making educational materials and patterning with Katherine — for over a year. Owen prints up the books that Jean writes and illustrates. She said that with just one idea, she can make up to 20 books on one topic. She brought out a book about clothing and explained that Katherine receives aix)ut 20 “bits” of information per book. Rebecca also makes individual “bits” that consist of an 11-by-ll-inch flash card with a See KATHERINE, page 6",
