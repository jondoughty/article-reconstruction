    "article_text": "Dirty politics. Once again we must deal with the disgrace of politicians who resort to personal attacks to fight their political battles. An example is the latest round of verbal fisticuffs between candidates George Bush and Robert Dole. Both Republicans, their personal attacks achieve only the destruction of respect for themselves and their political party in the public eye. Sure, politics is a stressful business in which success is difficult to gauge most of the time. A little victory in the headlines after an insulting exchange may give a feeling of success and reward. This unfortunate aspect of politics only proves that the current batch of individuals is so inept at political understanding that they cannot hold logical debate on the issues. Instead, to liven up the action for television, they attempt to degrade each other like kids on the playground. A case can be made that these attacks actually give insight to the true political animal that the public may never see. But political decisions must be based on hard facts, not the vengeful tactics of a candidate with a bad attitude. Is it also a reflection of the public’s apathy? Maybe the candidates would rather issue personal attacks because they know the public really doesn’t care or know anything about the issues. A public trained on soap operas is quickly bored to tears by politics. Why not liven things up and take a lesson from the soaps by attacking character flaws? It sure makes headlines and it sure gets people talking. At its roots this childlike insult trading destroys the political process. It diverts attention from the issues and trivializes the world’s most important political event.",
