People Genwating Energy will hold a Lenx>nstration (a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Diablo is a lemon\u00e2\u20ac\u009d demonstration), to show the economic consequences of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant. TTm Lemonstration, which will occur at Pacific Gas & Electric\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s San Luis Obispo office at 849 Monterey St., will oppoee ratepayws\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 support of Diablo Canyon. Mismanagement, design flaws, poor construction practices and the expenses inherent in nuclear power have driven the cost of the plant up to 93 billion from an original figure of 9315 million, according to P.G.AE. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With electrical demand dropping, unprecedented conservation by consumers, reserve margiiu about 15 percent over accepted levels, and the cost of the plant going aky high, the riectridty from Diablo Cimyon would be proliibitively expensive and unnecessary,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Manny Mansbach, a spokesperson for People Generating Energy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Promisee of power too che^i to meter have proven totally imtrue.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d According to the Wall St. Journal (Aug. 11, 1982), rate increasee of 20 peroent-60 percent have been commonplace in other areas of the country where nuclear plants have recently gone into the rats bass. 17\u00c2\u00bb Edison Electric Institute recently reported that peak s\\umner risctrical use, a key measure of power demand, has gone down for the first time in nearly 40 years, leaving the industry with a surplus generating capacity of 38.7 percent, t^ highest since 1938. i Fresh lemondade will be sold at the Lemonstration.
