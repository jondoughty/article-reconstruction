    "article_text": "If Bush is elected, he will most certainly pack in a solidly conservative Supreme Court, a legacy that will live with us well into the next century. The next president may be able to appoint as many as 160-200 lower court judges. The conservatives are systematically trying to reverse the gains of the whole civil rights era. Women seeking abortions will be branded criminals if Bush is elected. And what leaps will Bush make in the quest for better race relations? Who will he be accountable to, if even now we can’t get him to account for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal? A long resume is OK, if quantity is complemented by quality. Then there is Senator Dan Quayle. If the phrase “President Quayle” isn’t enough to make America wake up sweating in the middle of the night, Americans are sleeping much too soundly. There are still a few months before the election. If you haven’t been paying attention, start now. This election is not unimportant. As students, think what the Reagan/Bush administration has done for financial aid. What financial aid, you might rightly ask. At this point in the election, the Mustang Daily editorial staff is endorsing Michael Dukakis as the candidate of choice. other universities. Cal Poly is depriving its students of an important, and essential, aspect of college education — learning how to accept others by talking, socializing and learning together. I know many people at Cal Poly are working hard to increase the number of minority students on campus, but they are facing an uphill battle. Some black students I’ve talked with, and I’m certain other minority students feel the same, feel out of place and unwelcome on this campus sometimes, simply because they are a different race. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for recruiters to drastically increase the minority population on campus because minority high school students realize how few blacks, Hispanics and Asians attend Cal Poly. How can you sell minority students on this school if you can’t guarantee them they will feel welcome or have a large support network of other minority students? It disturbs me when 1 hear white students question how minority students can get into school here. I’ve heard some white students say blacks and other minorities only get into Cal Poly because of minority quotas. How ignorant, cruel and small-minded can students be? I hope that is not the prevailing attitude white students hold toward minority students. When I see blacks, hispanics and Asians on campus I do not question how they got here. Instead, I wish there were more minority students like them here. The next time you are walking to class in a sea of white faces think about what you are missing out on by attending Cal Poly. Clark Adams, a former classmate, said “He was not a guy to take a position on anything except who his date was on Friday night and where to get drunk on Saturday night.” Another classmate, Joseph Wirt, said Quayle majored in “girls, golf, and alcohol” at DePauw. Quayle’s college record was so spotty that a furor erupted in 1982 when the college announced it would award an honorary doctor of laws degree to Quayle. The faculty secretly voted 32-24 against awarding the degree. Despite Quayle’s assertion that he joined the National Guard to go to law school as soon as possible, he did not go to law school right away. He did not meet Indiana University law school’s academic requirements. “They wouldn’t take him in,” his father, James Quayle, told the Washington Post. A year later, “somehow he got in, he talked his way in” and attended night school, James Quayle said. Quayle said he wanted to bypass the military because of his interest in law, but there is no evidence that he accomplished anything as an attorney. Quayle’s friends in the legal profession cannot remember any cases that he handled. Almost immediately after opening his law practice, Quayle told his father he wanted to do something else and became assistant publisher of his father’s newspaper. His grandfather, Eugene Pulliam, who headed the most powerful newspaper empire in Indiana, was famous for blatantly mixing right wing politics and newspaper journalism with impunity. Quayle’s father was a member of the John Birch Society in the 1960s. The financial and editorial backing of his father got Quayle elected to the House in 1976. With the strong backing of his uncle’s Indianapolis newspapers he became a U.S. senator in 1980. Voters have an opportunity to beat Bush and bag Quayle in November. Dan Quayle is another example of the intellectually bankrupt yuppie scum the country club Republicans are trying to foist on the American public as a poor excuse for leadership. The voters can see through their goody-two-shoes facade and trite cliches. Behold, a new page in the Mustang Daily — Commentary. In the Tuesdays to come, students will be exposed to the commentary of writers from one end of the political and philosophical spectrum to the other — from students, professors and outside sources. Ideas and issues discussed won’t always be contemporary per se, and readers shouldn’t expect extraordinary insight or mind boggling profundities; writings of this nature are located in prestigious publications and books, penned by well-paid professionals or sagacious authors. Contributors to this page are not paid.' Articles and illustrations are welcomed and appreciated. Reading philosophy can do wonders for anyone concerned about increasing self-understanding and metaphysical awareness. This summer my philosophy professor required the class to read Plato’s Republic. I benefited tremendously. In the course of reading this classic and taking notes on the corresponding lectures, I began to understand why Plato is a philosophical giant — he has scattered pearls of wisdom throughout his works. To my delight, one of the pearls 1 discovered was quite simply the value of truth. And I learned that it is not important to be victorious in an argument; it is important to discover the truth, or learn what was formerly thought to be the truth was not that at all. This aided me, a habitual sophist, immensely. Needless to say, this pearl is all too scarce in our nation’s courtrooms and forums of political debate. ‘ Imagine the turmoil that would exist if this pearl were to come into vogue among lawyers and politicians. Yes, imagining the unimaginable is difficult. But perhaps I am too harsh. There are certainly many of the forementioned actors who realize the value of truth; however, they also know the odds against them succeeding in those media, should they hold this value in high regard, and thus reflect it in their comportment. It is no wonder legal and political mavericks are few and far between. Crusading to revolutionize those media is not an attractive prospect. It’s a cruel world to say the least and I am but a feeble and fragile creature. Sensible spirits often die bitter and resentful when they forsake their needs and desires, and those of their loved ones, in order to combat the seemingly ubiquitous dragons. For those not so brave and daring souls, that is, for the more selfish folk, myself included, I recommend seeking pearls of wisdom instead of clawing a way to the top of the manure heap. Beneficial change would occur more rapidly if a greater number of humans chose this path. The treasure maps to these pearls of wisdom are not so hard to find. One place they are located is in classic works of philosophy. Tom Carey, defensive lineman for the Cal Poly Mustangs, was named the Western Football Conference’s Defensive Player of the Week. The 6-2, 233-pound senior, had 11 tackles Saturday night against Angelo State, seven of which were solo and several that were for 50 negative yards. Mickey Russell well acquainted recorded 4 sacks. On the year the second tackier for the with 20 tackles. Carey was named to the WFC All-Conference second team last season for his defensive prowess. The vice president replied, “Yes, we shouldn’t trade arms for hostages, but we have made vast improvements in our antiterrorism.’’ Some hostages were freed during the arms dealing with Iran, but others were seized and nine Americans remain in captivity. A question about Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle brought another lively exchange. Bush defended his youthful running mate, said he had been subjected to unfair speculation and added, “he has my confidence.’’ Dukakis guessed that “for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very, very troubling notion.’’ The vice president and the Massachusetts governor shook hands at center stage before the debate and again after. “Good job,’’ Dukakis said to his Republican rival after their 90-minute clash. Both men then headed for post-debate rallies. “I enjoyed it. I thought it was a good night,” said Dukakis. Asked if he won, he replied, “People seemed to be pretty enthusiastic.” Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III said, “The vice president did an extraordinarily good job in our opinion.” He said he thought Bush “reinforced the differences we’ve been talking about.” The combatants argued their case a little more than six weeks before Election Day from behind wooden lecterns on a stage at Wait Chapel on Wake Forest University’s campus. The live audience at Wait Chapel on the Wake Forest University’s campus numbered a few thousand — but the television audience was in the millions. And with many voters still undecided, the campaigns treated the debate as a pivotal event. Neither man committed an obvious gaffe during the 90 minutes. An Associated Press panel of six veteran debate judges gave Dukakis a narrow edge over Bush. Three judges thought Dukakis won and three picked Bush, but the Democrat got the most points overall. Dukakis got top marks for presentation and organization, while Bush bested his opponent in refutation and reasoning. An ABC News poll of 639 debate-watchers taken immediately after the debate found that 44 percent rated Dukakis the winner, 36 percent gave the edge to Bush and 20 percent said it was a tie. The formal debate rules were designed to prohibit direct can-didate-to-candidate comment, but there was no shortage of hostilities. Analyzing and designing bridges.

Member Stephanie Ball said Dukakis did a good job covering such issues as the homeless, defense spending and the concerns of the middle class. Other viewers remained confused with the outcome. Halfway through the debate, Eric Linxwiler, a senior speech communications/political science major, said disgustedly, “(Dukakis) comes out with these cute one-liners and everyone claps. “(The audience) was indirectly led to support Dukakis” because “obviously the panel was leaning toward Dukakis,” he said. Organizers and participants were pleased with the 73 to l(X) viewers who attended the debate at Roae and Crown.",
