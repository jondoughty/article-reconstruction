    "article_text": "Reading philosophy can do wonders for anyone concerned about increasing self-understanding and metaphysical awareness. This summer my philosophy professor required the class to read Plato’s Republic. I benefited tremendously. In the course of reading this classic and taking notes on the corresponding lectures, I began to understand why Plato is a philosophical giant — he has scattered pearls of wisdom throughout his works. To my delight, one of the pearls 1 discovered was quite simply the value of truth. And I learned that it is not important to be victorious in an argument; it is important to discover the truth, or learn what was formerly thought to be the truth was not that at all. This aided me, a habitual sophist, immensely. Needless to say, this pearl is all too scarce in our nation’s courtrooms and forums of political debate. ‘ Imagine the turmoil that would exist if this pearl were to come into vogue among lawyers and politicians. Yes, imagining the unimaginable is difficult. But perhaps I am too harsh. There are certainly many of the forementioned actors who realize the value of truth; however, they also know the odds against them succeeding in those media, should they hold this value in high regard, and thus reflect it in their comportment. It is no wonder legal and political mavericks are few and far between. Crusading to revolutionize those media is not an attractive prospect. It’s a cruel world to say the least and I am but a feeble and fragile creature. Sensible spirits often die bitter and resentful when they forsake their needs and desires, and those of their loved ones, in order to combat the seemingly ubiquitous dragons. For those not so brave and daring souls, that is, for the more selfish folk, myself included, I recommend seeking pearls of wisdom instead of clawing a way to the top of the manure heap. Beneficial change would occur more rapidly if a greater number of humans chose this path. The treasure maps to these pearls of wisdom are not so hard to find. One place they are located is in classic works of philosophy.",
