    "article_text": "Thanksgiving is the beginning of the holiday season and the end to healthy eating habits for many people. Below are some suggestions that may help if you are trying to maintain your weight through the season. •\tDon’t overeat. When you feel full — STOP! You don’t need to stuff yourself because it is the holidays. •\tRemove skin and visible fat from meat. •\tTry low-fat or nonfat sour cream and mayonnaise in your favorite dips. •\tUse Cool Whip in place of whipped cream. •\tReplace high-fat ice creams with low-fat ice cream, ice milk or frozen yogi}rt. •\tBake or steam vegetables instead of preparing them in casseroles. •\tChoose light poultry meat instead of dark meat. •\tUse cooking spray to grease baking pans and also to saute vegetables. •\tPrepare hard rolls in place of crescents. •\tFix low-fat eggnog (see recipe below) rather than traditional eggnog. Eggnog is a tradition during the holiday season, however, it is very high in calories and fat. Here is a recipe for this holiday favorite with one-tenth of the fat as the traditional drink.
