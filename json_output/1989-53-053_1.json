    "article_text": "The dream of freedom for blacks in America is not something that died when Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in Memphis 20 years ago. The dreamer may be dead, but the dream is alive and well in the continued struggle for a nonracist America, a Cal State Sacramento professor said. David Covin, professor of government and ethnic studies at Sacramento, spoke in the Cal Poly Distinguished Afro-American Lecture Series Thursday to a crowd of about 65. Covin painted a disturbing picture of 1963 America. Imagine being assaulted knowing that whoever assaulted you would not be punished. Imagine having to pay full fare for a bus trip but not being able to sit down. Imagine being restricted or barred from using public facilities. Imagine not being able to vote. Blacks in this country (especially in the South) have not had to imagine the above racist policies, they’ve lived under them for a large part of this nation’s 200 years. Covin said. In short, they were excluded from the constitutional guarantees of the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.",
