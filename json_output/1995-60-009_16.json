    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — It is distressing for any parent to have a teen-aged child cited by police for drinking. For a high-profile family like Vice President A1 Gore’s, things are hardly helped by having it all played out in public. Tipper Gore said Ibesday their 16-year-old daughter, given a ticket last weekend, is wrestling with the public attention as well as \"the severe disappointment of her family and friends and herself.” Sarah Gore was cited Friday in suburban Montgomery County, Md., after a police officer saw her holding an open beer while sitting in a car outside a party. The driver of the car was not drinking. Civil citations also were issued to several other juveniles, police say. The maximum penalty for underage possession is $500. The family is dealing with Sarah’s situation privately, Mrs. Gore said, “talking to her like all families should to their teenagers about the availability of alcohol and the fact the temptations are out there.” “She broke our rules and she broke the law. She’s extremely miserable and unhappy, I can tell you that,” Mrs. Gore said in an interview on Fox Morning News.",
