    "article_text": "It was in February of this year that the world witnessed the miracle of “People Power” and Corazon Aquino’s revolution in the Philippines. I shall not soon forget the TV images of nuns throwing themselves in front of tanks. But now, nine months later, the miracle is rapidly dying. The fighting has not stopped, and Aquino finds herself in a baptism of fire. The Philippine nation is now more polarized than ever, with a Communist rebellion continuing unabated. Aquino hurt the Communists by getting rid of their rallying point:\tFerdinand Marcos. Perhaps she hoped that the rebels would lay down their arms, but they have in fact intensified the brutality of their attacks, especially in the cities. Communist-backed labor unions have subjected the fragile Philippine • economy to a number of strikes and work stoppages. All this has angered the military in general, and Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile in particular. Enrile wants to unleash more military power to finally end two decades of Communist subversion. But Aquino is holding back. She believes that the general source of the Communist revolution is the tremendous inequity and poverty in the Philippines, which she is trying to correct. She would like to see the rebels re-integrated into the government, and she made a point of pardoning several jailed Communist leaders after her inauguration. This put her at odds with Enrile and the military almost immediately. Warm up with jackets and sweats by Local Motion, Town & Country, Gotcha, Blllabong- At the Sea Barn in Avila Bdsch",
