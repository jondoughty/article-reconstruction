    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Southern CaUfomia should expect major earthquake soon, say two local scientists who suggest that the gravitatioaai pull of the sun and moon nmy have helped trigger great quakes here in the past. Astronomer Steven Kilston and geophysicist Leon Knopoff say Southern CaUfomia has entered a time when the puU of tun and moon is greatest on the San. Andreas Fault, and the most vulnerable time appears to be November 19f7. “But sre’re not predicting an carthquakf in November of I9C7,'* Knopoff empbasiz-ed. They said 10 of the 13 major earthquakes in the area in the last five decades occurred near sunrise or sunset, when there is a strong influence of solar gravity. Also, most oo-curred in nearly 11.6-year intervals that coincide with, the northernmost posUioa of the amon. Their findings were puMkhed in a 1903 article in Nature, a British science JoansaL aad have generated several studies since then.",
