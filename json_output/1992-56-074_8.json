    "article_text": "The Women’s Studies Lecture Series will feature one of Cal Poly’s own at its lunchtime seminar on Monday. Willi Coleman, coordinator of the Center for Women and Ethnic Issues, will speak on black women’s studies programs throughout the country at the noon to 1 p.m. meeting in staff dining room 3. Coleman also will discuss literature focusing on African-women’s studies and will explore why black women’s history has separated from women’s history in general. Born in New Orleans, Coleman earned her masters degree in social welfare from UC Berkeley. She also holds a bachelors degree in comparative culture from UC Irvine. In addition to teaching Women’s History at Cuesta College at night, Coleman is developing a course on California history through the eyes of women, beginning with indigenous women. Coleman, who has been at Cal Poly for 12 years, said she has been pleased with the long-overdue implementation of women’s studies and ethnic studies curricula. She also said she is surprised by the enthusiasm and support for the programs from the student body and feels the canrrpus is beginning to respond to issues more quickly and energetically than in the past. Coleman said that by ignoring issues or letting them pass, a campus forfeits its right to call itself a true university and said that she is ecstatic that Cal Poly students have begun to challenge what they’ve been spoon-fed. “There really has been an epiphany of some kind. Now is the time for us on campus to go with the energy that is flowing so beautifully at this point,” she said. Coleman would like to see students correct her own generation’s mistake of separating gender and race. “We need to formulate better questions around the issues of gender and race so we can get to some clarity,” Coleman said. “We need to look at ideas behind what we mean when we say ‘women’ and ‘minorities.’ ” Coleman believes that in order for the ethnic studies program to become a thorough one, it must address the gender issue. “As we see women’s studies and ethnic studies gear up as a reality, it’s important that both programs are reminded that they still need to broaden their bases of inquiry,” Coleman said. Coleman said the lecture series is one part of the whole picture that is broadening students’ ways of thinking. “I’m excited about this series. It’s absolutely wonderful. It’s dovetailing with some exciting things happening on campus, like ethnic studQes,” she said. Margaret Camuso, office administrator for the Academic Senate and co-chair of the Women’s Lecture Series, said the seminars were created to introduce faculty, staff and students to women’s scholarship. She said each session’s lecturer speaks to a packed room. “The seminars have given exposure to new perspectives to education issues. New feminist perspectives are being brought to curriculum matters in areas of women’s studies,” Camuso said. The free lectures are held every three weeks.",
