    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Charles Keating Jr., the free-spending, politically connected executive whose rise and fall came to epitomize the S&L debacle, faces up to 10 years in prison for defrauding junk bond investors. Keating sat grim-faced in Superior Court on Wednesday, his 68th birthday, as a jury found him guilty of 17 of 18 counts of duping investors about the safety of junk bonds sold through his now-collapsed Lincoln Savings & Loan. The bonds became worthless when Lincoln went under in a collapse that cost taxpayers $2.6 billion, the most expensive government bailout in U.S. history. “It’s the nicest birthday present he could give us — to find the S.O.B. guilty and send him to jail,” exulted Jeri Mellon, leader of a support group for those who bought the bonds. She lost $40,000 in Lincoln’s collapse. “There is a God!” cried Mimi Hines, who said her junk bond losses cost her a $1.2 million Malibu home. “It would be a gi*eat birthday present for him if he gets 68 years. Why, 99 years wouldn’t be long enough for this man.”",
