Several of these, including the proposal submitted by Mark Roland regarding student review of the instructor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s course syllabus, will ultimate- -ly be voted on by the student body. The, ASI and this newspaper will do their best to inform you of the issues prior to the election in order for you to make a knowledgmble choice. AtUeticFee A Senate Rescdution will be presented on Wednesday evening, Jan. 19. that will call for a student vote on an athletic fee referendum that will be used to determine whether or not students support a small fee that will provide support to the intercollegiate sports program and allow free admittance to all sporting events (except football games) for all Cal Poly students. Smosmer quarter With the proposed elimination of funding for this summer quarter included in the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bkdget, students must work to persuade the state legilsature of the false economy which tl^ represents. Clearly, if the governor is successful in this attempt, students will be forced to prolong their education and compete more heavily for classes during the regular terms. Below is* the address of freshman Assemblyman Eric Seastrand, and State Senator Ken Maddy (who is a strong voice on the Senate Finance (Committee). We encourage you to take the time to explain your concerns to these legislators. Assemblyman Eric Seastrand State Capitol Building Sacramento, California 95814 Senator Ken Maddy State Capitol Building Sacramento, California 96814 Financial Aid As the Mustang Daily noted last week, the Board of Trustees of th<h(!SU I ordered an additional $4 fee increase to pay for financial aid. This- unprecedented step indicates a growing move to shift the burden of maintaining access to the CSU to its students, and an abandonment of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respon-siblility. This issue will also be addrass-ed by the Student Senate at an upcoming meeting.
