    "article_text": "For the better part of the past three months the men’s track team has done all it can to qualify competitors for the national championships. And now, the day before the championships begin at Cape Girardeau, Mo., 11 athletes have qualified. The first to qualify in 1987 was freshman Steve Toney, who pole vaulted 16-1 in the first meet of the season at San Diego State. And, somewhat appropriately, it was pole vaulter Hans Florine who was the final qualifier at what is termed the Last Chance Meet at Cal State Los Angeles this past Sunday. Florine’s qualification is appropriate in that it brings the number of pole vaulters who will compete in Cape Girardeau to four, which is not surprising considering the Mustangs have been deep in pole vaulting all season. While Cal Poly has qualified 11 athletes, two — Dave Johnson and Brent Griffiths — have broken the NCAA Division 11 standards in two events. Although they have each qualified for two races, Johnson and Griffiths will more than likely compete in only one, due to the number of races that must be held in each event. Johnson, a senior hurdler, has qualified in both the highs and intermediates, although he is ex- pected to run only the intermediates. Cal Poly coach Tom Henderson said the only way Johnson will run the high hurdle race is if he doesn’t have to go through preliminary heats before reaching the championships on Saturday. “Our initial intent was not to run him (Johnson) in the highs,’’ said Henderson. “The whole emphasis this year has been on the intermediates with the intention of having him win it.’’ As it stands, 10 runners nationwide have qualified for the 110-meter hurdle race, which makes it possible that preliminary heats will still have to be run. Going into the meet, Johnson has the second fastest time nationwide in the intermediates and the eighth fastest in the highs. At the conference championships a week ago Johnson won both events. Griffiths, meanwhile, has qualified in both the 1,500 and 5,000-meter races, but will more than likely run only the longer of the two. He has the second-fastest time in Division 11 at 5,000 meters and if he ran in both events, the two final races would be only one hour and 50 minutes apart. Among the pole vaulters who qualified — Toney, Florine, Kevin Rankin and Steve Horvath — Horvath is the top ranked of the four. The sophomore vaulter cleared a height of \\1-5Va two weeks ago at the Nick Carter Invitational in Santa Barbara and is ranked third in the nation in his event and is second on the all-time Cal Poly list. Rankin, meanwhile, qualified for nationals early in the season and has spent the past several weeks recovering from a hip injury he suffered at the West Coast Relays in Fresno the first week of April. “He’s fine and he’s been jumping very well,” said Henderson. “At the conference meet the pressure was on and everything that could have gone wrong did.” At the conference meet in Nor-thridge, Rankin had a pole break and didn’t finish among the top six Cal Poly finishers. Despite the Mustangs’ great depth in pole vaulting, they will have to come up with some strong performances if they are to knock off the nation’s top two competitors, who both vault for top-ranked Abilene Christian. The Texas university has a tradition of turning out strong pole vaulters and has claimed the national champion in the event every year since 1982 when it joined DivisionTl. Among the other Cal Poly qualifiers are sprinter Erik Josephson, who is ranked fourth in the 200-meter event, Jeff Al-quist, who is ranked fourth in the 3,000-meter steeplechase and Mike Livingston, who has the fourth fastest time at 10,000 meters. Josephson, who has steadily improved his times throughout the season, has a definite shot at picking up a national title, said Henderson. “The sprints are very volatile so it’s a good shot for him there,” he said. But, realizing the instability of the sprints, Josephson said, “When you get there it’s just another race.” With the exception of the four pole vaulters, the Mustangs have qualified two other field competitors. Brant Warren will compete in the javelin with the second-best Division II mark this season. while Anthony Mudy will compete in the high jump after qualifying Sunday at Los Angeles. Mudy jumped 6-1 IVi in Los Angeles despite spending the early part of the season out of competition with an injury. “That was a lot of time off and he’s a little behind,’’ said Henderson. “His height is OK, but his timing has been a little off.” The Mustangs placed 11th in the national meet last year with seven competitors, and with the increase in number of athletes and higher marks, Henderson is expecting even more this year. “If everyone scores like they’re capable we have the potential to finish in the top five and maybe in the top three.”",
