    "article_text": "After lengthy discussion Wednesday, the ASI Board of Directors voted to accept the results of the November referendum election and passed the ballot on to President Warren Baker with its recommendations. The board felt compelled to vote on the issue, even though some of the directors felt rushed, because it was told that Baker was making his decision before Dec. 31, and ASI will not meet again until the second week of January. “By Dec. 31, President Baker will make a decision on renewing contracts of many coaches,” said Chairman of the Board Dennis Albiani. “President Baker, basically in an IRA election, has the final authority.” The board debated the issue for two hours before unanimously approving the Nov. 20-21 vote. Students filled U.U. room 220, where the meeting was held, to voice their concerns about the recent election, particularly in regard to the athletics referendum. Some of their concerns addressed alleged fraudulent voting, pressures put on by the athletics department and questions as to the objectivity of the IRA task force. In its recommendations to Baker, the board expressed concern about athletes violating the Interhall Council Solicitation policy by going door to door in the residence halls distributing information and persuading students to vote yes. The board also addressed a complaint filed that students used telephones in the athletics department to persuade yes votes. The election results were presented by Dan Nail, director from the School of Agriculture and chairman of the Elections Committee. He said that the committee had investigated all filed complaints. Nail said the use of telephones and solicitation of residence halls were not brought to his attention in time for him to prevent them, and now those incidents are the responsibility of the university. Dennis Lang, director from the School of Business, was worried about the election count. “If anybody put in a fake social security number or a fake name, we have done nothing to check to see if those names are actually students,” he said. The board included a request that the university check all names and social security numbers to make sure the students were registered. Some directors felt rushed in their decision on the issue and pleaded for more time. Others pushed to approve the election. “By postponing (approval of) the election, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the See ASI, page 12 10,000 students that voted on that day,” said Paul Sahargun, director from the School of Science and Math. “Dr. Baker is going to make a decision. It’s up to us to make sure we get the students’ opinions to him.” Todd Fernandes, director from the School of Agriculture, felt much the same way. “I don’t see why we’d want to postpone it,” he said. “Basically, it’s forfeiting our rights to advise him.” Deirdre Flynn, director from the School of Agriculture, added that only one formal complaint was actually valid in objection to the election results because it was the only complaint to be filed within 24 hours of the election results. That complaint was of the students’ use of coaches’ telephones. Nail felt that some directors were focusing on the outcome of the election rather than looking at the election process which is what they had to vote on. “You have to separate your emotions on the outcome of this election,” Nail said. Before the final vote. President’s Representative Hazel Scott commended the board on their lengthy discussion. “We broke our own record (in number of votes),” Scott reminded the board. “Truly, the student body has spoken.”",
