    "article_text": "With respect to the story by John Hubbell and Deanna Wulff which appeared in the front page of Friday’s Mustang Daily (Feb. 14, 1992), I would like to clarify that the quote attributed to me belongs to Professor Alurista of the foreign languages department who also spoke at the rally. My presentation focused principally on the misconceptions most members of the university community have concerning affirmative action and the suggestion that one way to remedy this situation is to embrace the many benefits which ethnic studies offers to everyone, not just members of minority groups. By its very definition, ethnic studies provides validation and recognition of the many contributions made by all ethnic groups which make up the United States, rather than just those of the dominant minority. Jorge C. Aguiniga Former Faculty You’re absolutely right Mr. Sharp! The Cal Poly chapter of the American Marketing Association was responsible for bringing the Nintendo Campus Challenge to our school. I’m not aware of the evil, “malicious and monopolistic” activities you claim Nintendo participates in. Nor am I aware they “violate nearly every antitrust legislation we have.” What I am aware of is that they are the only company sponsoring an event marketing collegiate tour. McCann and Erickson Event Marketing, hired to administer the challenge, told AM A thev would love to make our campus a stop on their nationwide tour. A stop which benefited marketing majors, staff and Cal Poly students in a variety of ways. Innovative Marketing Concepts, a committee of AMA, seeks projects that provide students with “learn by doing” practical marketing experience before they graduate. Members of IMC and AMA gained invaluable practical experience by seeking what goes into event marketing promotions. Students helped McCann and Erickson field representatives with the setup and tear down of the “big black behemoth of an eyesore.” In addition, they provided the staff required to accommodate such an event and learned how marketing companies tabulate results and determine marketing impact. How did staff and students benefit? Business professors had the opportunity to see what one industry, event marketing, does to help companies expose themselves to the huge college consumer market. Students not only had a great time, but the Cal Poly Challenge champion was put into a drawing, with champions from 31 other campuses, for a $50,000 savings bond. Runners-up received $100 for first, $75 for second and $50 for third. If you’re worried about the marketing impact on the campus, then let’s get rid of all the Pepsi and Coke machines, as well as other marketing devices, that luminate their logo 24 hours a day and seven days a week. These use electricity and school supplies. Nintendo had McCann and Erickson bring their own generator.",
