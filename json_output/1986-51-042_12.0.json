    "article_text": "climate, consisting of warm, dry days and cool nights, allows a proper balance between sugar and acid levels to develop. “Acidity stays higher in this climate,’’ said Fountain. “It wouldn’t hold under a hot climate.’’ Clay Thompson, winemaker for both Chamisal Vineyards and for his own brand, Claiborne and Churchill, said that a lot of the climate characteristics can be attributed to the ocean breezes. “It’s the cool ocean air that comes down from Morro Bay and blows right down across the Los Osos V alley into the Edna Valley,’* he said. “It makes a long, cool growing season, which is good for the Chardonnay.’’ Just on the other side of Cuesta Ridge and in the San Joaquin Valley, said Thompson, the climate is too hot in the summer for the types of grapes grown in Central Coast regions. Victor Roberts, winemaker for Crestón Manor Vineyards and Winery, said the soil also plays an important role. “What we’re looking for is clay and sandy loam, a lack of underlying hard-pan, and land that accepts water well,’’ he said. “You have to have soil that resists compaction.’’ Roberts said the owners of Crestón Manor spent almost two years looking throughout California for good vineyard land. The combination of climate and soil conditions on the Central Coast is what they were looking for to create a good balance of sugar and acid leveb in the grapes. But Fountain mentioned other incentives that made local valleys attractive. In the early 1970s, he said, increased grape production was needed to meet a predicted increase in wine consumption. The land at that time was comparatively very cheap on the Central Coast, and banks were willing to loan »lot of money to help growers get started, said Fountain. Now, Fountain said, land values are even higher than for the well-known and long-established Napa Valley vineyards north of San Francisco. “Vines need to be at least 10 years old to get the full flavors of the varietals,’’ said Fountain. “The vineyards are just now maturing.’’ He said many local vineyards are just now starting to produce the best quality grapes in their history.",
