Each fraternity arrd sorority organizes their own events to raise money for local and national chari- tles such as canned food drives for the local Grassroots Association, marathon-type events for the National Heart Association and local blood drives. Greeks are also involved in campus projects. Alpha Sigma is In charge of maintenance of the \"P.\" All the fraternities operate and participate In the Interfraternity Council Escort Service, and on Good Neighbor Day every fraternity and sorority participates. Last year more than three-fourths of the partlcl- pants ware from the Greek community. In addition to philanthropic activities, most Graeks are vary active contributors to Cal Poly.

This year more than half of the ASI PresI dent's executive staff Is Greek Greeks are also Involved In ASI committees, clubs, sports and other extra-curricular activities.",
