    "article_text": "Innovations through research are usually not associated with non-land grant universities such as Cal Poly, but there is a variety of ongoing research and development on campus. Land grant universities were set up in the late 19th century by President Abraham Lincoln with the primary purpose of doing research, said Ed Carnegie of the Cal Poly agricultural engineering department.\t, , , . ■The largest, f^jgricu|t)iral solsf ,4ehydfator in the world was. designed at Cal P<My and cdnstructjed in Fresno by studenu and faculty of the unversity. said Camesie. The facility dries one-half ton of raisins per hour. It has been operating for sevep years and has proven to be one of the most economical designs known for a solar dehydrator^ It has a much shorter pay-off period than other government-funded ’ projects, Carnegie said. .. “A lot of OUT projects start off aa student projecu,\" Carnegie .said. ^'I like to bring real-life problems into the classroom' and have my students work on solutions.” One of Carnegie’s^ best project memories began when the direc-tor of research for the California Almond Advisory Board called 'him looking for a way to get rid of bio-mass in almond orchards left after the aop has been pruned. The board was concerned with not being able to bum waste products in the future, said Carnegie. ”1 invited him to talk to my design class about the problem. He wasn’t Very optimistic, but agreed to com and talk to the class. They presented their infor- -mation -as if they war* in business.” The research director said he got more information in four weeks from the students than he had ^in several months from a consuhing firm he paid $30,000, , according to Carnegie. The concept was further developed and resulted in a USDA grant to build a prototype' solid waste compactor designed spedficaly for the California almond grower. It is currently being built on campus by students, said Carnegie.
