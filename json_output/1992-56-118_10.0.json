As students, we spend a great deal of our time devoted to listening. We listen to professors, public, peers, television and radio. Statistics reveal the majority of our time is spent listening, but the question to ask yourself is how are you listening? Actively? Passively? Effectively? I find it surprising that we are constantly reinforced to improve our writing and reading skills, but not our listening. Ek> we feel our listening potential has been reached? The fact is most of us are relatively poor listeners. Given the amount of time we engage in listening, the improvement of this skill would seem well worth the required effort. Listening is not an easy task. It takes time and energy to listen effectively. However, through the power of listening, friendships and other relationships can blossom and grow positively.",
