    "article_text": "The recent cold weather has meant more to the crop science department than just bringing out more warm winter clothes. According to Corwin Johnson, head of the department, the cold weather has caused some damage to the citrus and avocado groves on campus. On the night and early morning of Jan. 16 and 17, the temperature in the citrus and avocado groves and other areas of campus dropped to a record low of 23 degrees. â€˜ Johnson said members of the crop science department and project classes which grow the plants began heating the area at about 11 p.m. when the temperature dropped below freezing. The area was heated with diesel burning pots, called orchard heaters, which heated the air around the trees, and a wind machine which kept frost from forming. Johnson said that although the heaters were on, workers could not hold the temperature high enough to prevent some freezing, especially on the avocado trees. The most severe damage was done to avocado trees which were out of range of the orchard heaters, but most of the trees suffered some minor damage. Johnson said that in the citrus groves, with the use of one wind machine and the orchard heaters, workers were able to hold the temperature above 28 degrees. As a result the citrus trees suffered only minor damage. Though Jan. 16 and 17 were the coldest, the workers still needed to heat the areas again the following two days. On other cold nights during the past few weeks, the temperature did not fall below 32 degrees until daybreak; as a result the air did not stay cold long enough to need heating. The cold weather also caused some minor damage to other crops on campus. Some senior project summer crops were lost, and some vegetable crops may have been set back a little in their growth. As far as long term damage from the cold snap, Johnson said there will be very little if any profit from the citrus and avocado crops because of the high cost of electricity and fuel for the heaters. In addition, some of the avocado trees may have been damaged to the point that they may not produce new buds and fruit next year. Johnson said that in the 26 years that he has been at Cal Poly, this is the most cold weather damage he has seen. According to Ronald Regan, head of the ornamental horticulture department, some potted and tropical plants outside the OH Unit suffered minor frost damage. Regan said most of the plants at the unit are grown in hothouses and therefore were protected from the cold.",
