    "article_text": "IRAQ (AP) — In its first statement on the missile attack that killed 28 servicemen aboard the USS Stark, Iraq said President Saddam Hussein had ordered a “serious investigation” to determine if the Iraqi air force was responsible. “Iraq would never intentionally attack any target in the gulf unless it was an Iranian target. If this attack was indeed carried out by Iraqi warplanes, then it would have been a result of confusion by the pilots,” an unidentified Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman told the official Iraqi news agency. The spokesman urged U.S. officials to be patient until the investigation was done and said Iraq would “publicly announce the results of the investigation and apologize with sorrow” if its air force was behind the attack. “We expect an apology and compensation for the men who died in this tragic incident,” a White House statement said. “We also seek compensation for the ship.” President Reagan expressed “concern and anger” Monday over the missile strike and he put U.S. forces on heightened alert in the Persian Gulf with authority to fire at threatening warplanes. Vice Adm. Henry C. Mustin, deputy chief of Naval operations, said the ship knew it had been “locked on” by the warplane’s radar — a prelude to attack — and that the Stark attempted twice by radio to warn the attacker that it was an American ship. He said it was not known whether the message was received.",
