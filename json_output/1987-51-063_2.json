    "article_text": "The versatility a speech communication degree offers in adapting to any job situation was a main point stressed at a career information symposium Saturday. Presented by the Cal Poly speech department and an internship project of Word of Mouth President Christine Fagerlin, the symposium featured former Cal Poly speech communication graduates who have entered various career fields. “Most U.S. industry is becoming more service and marketing orientated,” said Bob Perry, a 1971 graduate and bank manager. “A the Marines of Okinawa, Japan. One captain is sent to a village to Americanize it, but instead the village makes a Japanese out of him. According to technical director Howard Gee, the goat has rather a small part, but it’s a part which will have the audience grinning. Lady Astor, the name of the goat in the play, has two small scenes. In the show a boy, played by freshman animal science major Scott Hansford, leads the goat around, so the goat will not be unsupervised. Hansford himself raised goats when he lived at home, so he sees no problem in acting with the goats in the play. “Once they get used to me in rehearsal it should be pretty easy,” he said. Millie and Tillie are not even a year old, Hanley explained; they will celebrate their first birthday on Valentine’s Day. Last year during Poly Royal the goats were part of the petting zoo so they are used to being around people. Millie is all black, and Tillie is a striking black and white. While watching the goats perform, Hanley explained that goats are personable animals, and hers especially love almonds. Coke, and beer. Goats live to be about 15 or 16 years old-, and Hanley said her goats are reared for milk production. Elizabethan playwright, the goats tried to take a nibble out of the book. “I’d say the goat needs to show passion, a rage of emotion, have pretty eyes, and a great smile,’’ Kenvin joked as he watched the two goats perform. The goat is probably the luckiest performer, as it gets its own dressing room (the lawn outside the theatre) and its own entrance (through the garage behind the stage.) Live animals are not something new to the Cal Poly stage. According to Gee, a live pony was used in a production of “Cinderella’’ a few years ago. Kenvin is also not a newcomer to having animals in his productions. In the musical “Showboat’’ he had a Great Dane who refused to perform one night. “Actually, I think that animals and children are easier to work with than adults,’’ Kenvin said. Toward the end of the audition, Kenvin was toying with the idea of putting both goats in the play instead of just one, or using one of the goats as an understudy. He seemed a little discouraged that more goats did not show up. “It’s a reflection of American theater when goats’ ambitions don’t rise above their stomachs,’’ he said. work,” Gilbert said. For Fagerlin, the symposium culminated months of organizing and provided the opportunity for speech communication colleagues to come together. “Networking and utilizing resources by making and keeping contacts was a valuable part of the symposium,” Fagerlin said.",
