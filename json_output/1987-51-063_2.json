    "article_text": "People auditioning for a play is a common occurrence, but goats auditioning for a play is quite a different story. Such was the case at a goat audition Saturday for the Cal Poly production of “Teahouse of the August Moon.” Two goats, Millie and Tillie, along with their owner, Joan Hanley, showed up to audition for the play. The goats did not appear nervous as they cavorted about before showing off for the director of- the play, Roger Kenvin. However, it quickly became a matter of sibling rivalry when the two goats tried to outdo each other for the coveted spot. In one of the scenes in the play, the goat is supposed to jump onto a jeep. To recreate that scene, the goats were to jump onto a table. Unfortunately, the goats had other ideas. While their owner tried to coax them with some eucalyptus branches, and Kenvin bribed them with readings from Shakespeare, the goats were not impressed. Only after Kenvin put the Shakespeare book away did Tillie show that she could jump on the table. Not to be outdone, Millie followed suit. “Teahouse of the August Moon” is a play about the occupation by the Marines of Okinawa, Japan. One captain is sent to a village to Americanize it, but instead the village makes a Japanese out of him. According to technical director Howard Gee, the goat has rather a small part, but it’s a part which will have the audience grinning. Lady Astor, the name of the goat in the play, has two small scenes. In the show a boy, played by freshman animal science major Scott Hansford, leads the goat around, so the goat will not be unsupervised. Hansford himself raised goats when he lived at home, so he sees no problem in acting with the goats in the play. “Once they get used to me in rehearsal it should be pretty easy,” he said. Millie and Tillie are not even a year old, Hanley explained; they will celebrate their first birthday on Valentine’s Day. Last year during Poly Royal the goats were part of the petting zoo so they are used to being around people. Millie is all black, and Tillie is a striking black and white. While watching the goats perform, Hanley explained that goats are personable animals, and hers especially love almonds. Coke, and beer. Goats live to be about 15 or 16 years old-, and Hanley said her goats are reared for milk production. During the audition, the curious animals unabashedly sniffed into other people’s faces, and Tillie tried a taste of pen and paper. Apparently she did not enjoy it, for she quickly abandoned it for tastier things such as eucalyptus branches. Hanley explained that getting the goats to do something can be rather difficult in a different surrounding, but they quickly adapted to the newfound attention of the people at the audition. The only thing that did not seem to impress Millie and Tillie was Kenvin’s request that they read from Shakespeare. Instead of showing a penchant for the Elizabethan playwright, the goats tried to take a nibble out of the book. “I’d say the goat needs to show passion, a rage of emotion, have pretty eyes, and a great smile,’’ Kenvin joked as he watched the two goats perform. The goat is probably the luckiest performer, as it gets its own dressing room (the lawn outside the theatre) and its own entrance (through the garage behind the stage.) Live animals are not something new to the Cal Poly stage. According to Gee, a live pony was used in a production of “Cinderella’’ a few years ago. Kenvin is also not a newcomer to having animals in his productions. In the musical “Showboat’’ he had a Great Dane who refused to perform one night. “Actually, I think that animals and children are easier to work with than adults,’’ Kenvin said. Toward the end of the audition, Kenvin was toying with the idea of putting both goats in the play instead of just one, or using one of the goats as an understudy. He seemed a little discouraged that more goats did not show up. “It’s a reflection of American theater when goats’ ambitions don’t rise above their stomachs,’’ he said.",
