    "article_text": "The International Programs office is looking for students intereated in a year of college study abroad. Cal Poly sends about 100 students to overseas universities each year through the California State Univeraity systemâ€™s International Programs. Last year 96 studmts from Cal Poly spent a year at an overseas campus through the foreign study program. â€œIt isnâ€™t something thatâ€™s just for rich Idds,â€™â€™ said Holly White, past Alumni Assistant at the Cal Poly ' bran^ of the program. â€œItâ€™s for swious students who also have a sense of adventure.â€™â€™ White said most foreign study programs involve European universities. The most popular and competitive programs overseas we in ajxhitecture and business. White said Cal Polyâ€™s strength in these two majors â–  accounts for the high proportion of students from this campus who are selected for foreign study programs. Students can study at universities in 15 different countries through CSU International Programs. Depending on the foreign university they want to attend, students must have at least a 2.75 or a S.OO GPA. Students must also have junior standing by the time thsy intend to leave for overseas study in order to be considered for the program. All units named abroad will transfer back to CSU campuses, and any financial aid students received in CaUfomia can be applied to overseas study. The cost of a year of overseas study for a student dspends on the cost of living in the country. It ranges from 94,500 for a year in Mezko to 98,000 for a year in Danmark, according to Joanns LeBaron, this yearâ€™s Alumni Assistant for the program. â€œIt also depends on the extracurricular activities that go along with studies,â€ shsadded. White and LeBaron both said a ymr of study at a foreign university impresses proqwctive empk>3rers and helps students get into graduate schools. Experience in a foreign culture and in foreign studies is something most people donâ€™t have, LeBaron stressed. Students whose majors and career goals would best coordinate with overseas university study programs are most likely to be accepted to the international study program, LeBaron said. To bs chosen for the program, students must apply and are then interviewed, indents who want to study at universities in Spain, France, Peru or Brazil must have two years of college study in the countryâ€™s language. Students going to Japan, New Zealand, Denmark, and some other countries do not have to have any experience in foreign language. TTie application deadline for the foreign study program in Feb. 9. Applications are available in the International Programs office in Room 211 in the Dexter Library Building. Interested students can drop by the office or call 546-2915.",
