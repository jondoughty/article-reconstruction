Out of that With a new quarter beginning, stress and expectations for students are high, and so is the possibility of depression if the stress becomes too much and expectations are not met. But how do you know if your depression is bad enough that you need help? Peer Health Educators, along with workers from Health Services, Psychological Services, and the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), will be screening for depression from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday in the UU Plaza. The free screening is part of National Depression Screening Day (NDSD). Students, faculty and staff can take the anonymous 10 to 15 minute assessment tool — a series of questions to determine your emotional health — then go upstairs to UU 219 to go over their results. *At that time they can meet with a therapist or a Peer Health educator to review their test scores,” Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Coordinator Jean DeCosta explained. ”Those that need it are referred for follow-up counseling.” There will also be a presentation on depression, including a slide show and video, at 1 p.m. in UU219. NDSD began five years ago, but this is the first year Cal Poly has participated. Last year, 82,000 people attended screenings nationwide. *Cal Poly wants their students to be successful,” DeCosta said. ”This is one of the programs that ensiu'es that students will do well. *We know more about depression than ever before,” Def^osta continued. ”We can do more for depression as far as treatment, counseling and medical help. There’s a real movement to raise awareness. \"Depression is an illness, not a weakness. \\bu can’t snap out of it like a cold,” she continued. *With early detection though, you can do something about it. You don’t have to live with it.” EAP Specialist Bob Negranti, explained an interesting aspect of the screening day. \"It seems most programs are either just for students, or just for employees,” Negranti said. \"This program is for the entire campus population.” Student Affairs provides medical help, psychological help and counseling to students through Peer Health Education. Help for faculty and staff is available through EAP. \"The screening day lets everyone know that the resources to treat depression are available on campus,” Negranti said. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, over 17 million Americans are affected by depression each year, but only half actually receive treatment. Twice as many women suffer from depression than men. Some of the warning signs that someone may be depressed include: a significant change in appetite, sleep disturbances, fatigue and feelings of worthlessness. The major difference between just feeling down and having the blues has to do with the intensity and longevity of the sadness. When someone is depressed, it affects the entire body. The way in which they eat, sleep and think may change. DeCosta explained that even when something positive happens to someone, depression can strike. \"Sometimes when something good happens, like getting into Cal Poly, it can cause you to get depressed,” DeCosta said. \"Lots of freshman feel the loss of their parents and friends. Out of that good event, you can wind up getting depressed. \"Generally, depression runs in the family,” she continued. \"If parents or close family suffer from depression, then they may have a higher propensity to be depressed.” For anyone who does not feel comfortable taking the assessment test at the screening booth, an appointment can be made with counseling services for assessment and possible treatment of depression. \"There’s nothing to be ashamed of. You’re not ashamed when you have a common cold,” DeCosta said. \"Many times people feel bad about feeling depressed. So they wouldn’t treat themselves,” she said. \"If you have depression don’t be ashamed of it - we’ll try to get you the help you need.” The 1996 primary election in March may seem far away, but prospective candidates will soon begin pounding the pavement for registered voter signatures. Because California is a \"big swing-vote state,” its primary is a month earlier than in previous years, said Craig Driver, San Luis Obispo County elections clerk. In the past, California’s votes were among the last to get tallied, he said. But this year, the state’s primary is one of the first. In a 1994 California State Senate bill, the March primary became enacted into law. The new primary election date was passed on a trial period and will be effective until Jan. 1, 1998, unless another law repeals or extends it. In preparation for the primary, campaigning will begin early as well, l^e first step in this year’s political joust is candidates’ declaration of intent to run for office. Next, most applicants will tiy to get their candidacy filing fee waived. Credit toward the fee, which amounts to 1 percent of the candidate’s salary, is earned at the rate of 44 cents per valid signature. Candidates can start accumulating signatures Oct. 21 to Nov. 29, Driver said. \"Congresswoman Andrea Seastrand (R-Calif.) will need over 3,000 registered voter’s signatures to get her $1,336 fee waived,” he said. Perspective congressional opponent Walter Capps, who lost to Seastrand last year by less than a 1 percent margin, plans to run again and is already formulating his campaign strategy. Capps, a religious studies professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara for the past 30 years, attributed his approximate 1,500-vote defeat to his late start in the race. He did not begin campaigning until February 1994. lb combat last year’s campaign setbacks, Capps has already made a few low-profile visits to Cal Poly’s campus in order to make his name known to students. Capps plans on making several highly-publicized visits to Pbly within the next few weeks. Another candidate who plans on speaking to prospective student voters is Tbm Bordonaro. Bordonaro will lecture to several Cal Pbly business classes on Oct. 4. Although campaigning is well on its way, the 1996 campaign issues are still unclear. \"It will depend on the presidential election issues and what Congress accomplishes in welfare and Medicare and Medicaid reform,” Capps said. Capps, who favors Medicare reform, feels that the Republican party is not giving FVesident Clinton legislation he will be able to approve. \"The way the Republicans are going about it is deceptive,” he said. \"Integrity clearly remains the issue.” Capps aims to \"re-create the bond of trust between the people and Washington, D.C.” He urges voters to vote for what they hope will be accomplished not the lesser of two evils. Balancing the budget is the top priority for incumbent Seastrand, according to her press secretary Stuart Roy. \"In Congress, Seastrand believes she is doing the right things,” Roy said. Her first priority is reducing the deficit to spur economic growth, which would in turn create more jobs, Roy said. Therefore, she is in Washington, D.C. working on Medicare reform and will not begin campaigning until January. \"Since April, she had three town meetings in San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Santa Maria targeted toward senior citizen constituents,\" he said. Once constituents realized that Medicare reform was neces-___________See\tCAMRMGN poge 5 ■ary to prevent bankruptcy by the year 2002, they were open to give suggestions on reform. The meetings allowed Seastrand to go before Congress and share her constituents’ concerns for having a choice of doctors and health care options, Roy ■aid. Seastrand has also represented the voice of other Central Coast concerns throughout the year. WASHINGTON — Hitting Congress in its pocketbook, President Clinton vetoed the legislative branch budget Hies-day and told lawmakers he wouldn’t budge imtil they make concessions on a larger spending Though the Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich said in a joint statement. The White House said Clinton supported the bill and its cuts, but vetoed it as a sign of his frustration over the slow progress of budget deliberations. Issuing the third veto of his presidency, Clinton rejected a measure that would let Congress spend $2.2 billion this fiscal year — a $200 million reduction from last year’s budget. The move opened Clinton to attack from Republicans. *President Clinton has put politics ahead of cutting govern- providing money for military ment spending,” Senate Majority construction projects, including family housing. The approval came despite the measure’s inclusion of $70 million in projects Clinton said amounted to wasteful GOP spending and pointed up the need for a line-item veto. Both actions carried political risks for Clinton. In the latest round of political gamesmanship over the budget, the president actually approv^ one bill he said wasted taxpayers’ money and vetoed another that would cut government spending — a bill he said he liked. Clinton’s action and the GOP response were the latest tit-for-tat in a war between the White House and Republicans over spending priorities, especially on Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. The president has threatened to veto eight of the 13 spending bills. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston said Clinton had “no substantive grounds for a veto” of the congressional budget. *The president can’t have it both ways,\" said Livingston, R-La. “He can’t lecture the Congress on political reform while vetoing the first real effort in 40 years to reform the Congress.” White House aides said the veto carried out a threat Clinton made weeks ago, hoping that it would make Congress look like the selfish party in the budget debate. Approving the military bill gave the president a chance to push again for the line-item veto. Clinton said the $70 million in military projects approved by Congress — but not requested by the Pentagon — illustrate why: “The taxpayers’ deserve protection from this kind of wasteful spending.” Republicans made passage of the line-item veto a key part of their campaign “Contract With America” last year. While the House and Senate have passed different versions, negotiators have not yet developed a compromise measure. Democrats contend that the Republicans don’t want to give Clinton that power. Prostate cancer generally is slow growing, said Fair, and if it can be slowed even more “then it is possible that many men wouldn’t need anything more than dietary manipulation.” Most prostate cancers develop around the age of 60, said Fair, and “if we are able to a tell a 60-year-old that he could do something to slow growth of the cancer for 30 years, that’s the same as a cure for most men.” In the mouse study. Fair and his colleagues ii\\jected human róstate cancer cells into special aboratory mice that can grow human cancers. The mice, at the time, were being fed a com oil diet that included 40.5 percent fat, about the same fat content in the diet of the average American male adult. Once the prostate cancer tumors started growing in the mice, the animals were divided into four groups and each group started receiving different levels of fat, ranging from a high o( 40.5 percent to a low of 2.3 percent fat per calorie. After 11 weeks, the mice were killed and tumor growth was measured. Blood chemistry from the animals was also compared. Himor growth was 2^2 times greater in mice on the high-fat ffiet than for mice on the lowest-fat diet. For mice on a 21.2 percent fat diet, the tumor growth was about half that of the mice on the highest-fat diet. Fair said the difference also was reflected in tested levels of prostate specific antigen, or PSA, in the rodents’ blood. High levels of PSA are often indicative of cancer growth. Mice on the leanest diet had PSA counts about 35 percent of the level of mice on the high-fat diets. Dr. J. Michael Gaxiano and Dr. Charles H. Hennekens, both of Harvard Medical School, said in a Journal editorial that the findings “have contributed important and relevant data to an emerging body of evidence on dietary fat and risk of prostate cancer.” They said the studies raise the possibility that diet can play a role in both the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer, but warned that the findings have to be verified in human clinical trials. Southern California forests have some of the biggest budgets in the Forest Service, said Harry Croft, assistant director for planning in the service's fire and aviation department. But a substantial amount of their funding year after year has been lost to high overhead costs, such as support staff and high rents, he said. Washington has warned Southern California officials to curb their overhead costs, \"but a lot of the line officers have either been in denial or reluctant to look at the issue,” Croft said. Harbour and others dispute this claim, saying the real problem stems from budget tightening at the federal level, increases in the cost of leasing firefighting equipment, changes in the way federal money has been spread among California’s national forests by the Forest Service’s regional office in San Francisco and a change in the rules regarding use of a special emergency fire fund. eastward across the Florida Panhandle to the mouth of the Suwannee River on Florida’s northwest Gulf Coast. Opal had passed over Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, killing at least 10 people and leaving 20 missing, and causing flooding that drove more than 20,000 people from their homes in Campeche state. By late Tiesday afternoon it was centered about 380 miles south-southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River, with maximum sustained wind about 100 mph, and its moisture had spread into the northeast-central Gulf Coast region. It already had caused coastal flooding in southern Texas. Workers were evacuated from offshore drilling rigs near Alabama’s Dauphin Island and elsewhere along the coast as gusty thunderstorms moved in. Residents of low-lying areas of far southern Louisiana also headed to higher ground. James said the new defensive system, which implements zone coverage and mixes up defensive play calling, gives the secondary an advantage that they didn’t have last year. “When you’re lining up, playing bump *n run, it’s very tiring for the comers,” said Lombardi, speaking of last year’s defensive system. The new defensive system is not the only reason for their improvement. With the addition of Davis, who came to Cal Poly from Oregon State, where he red shirted for one year, the secondary gained speed and toughness. “He’s a big guy,” Lombardi said. “He can come in and lay a hit, and he’s got the athletic ability to cover guys.” Patterson said that Davis’ potential is great. Davis hasn't played football since he graduated from high school two years ago. “We haven’t seen how good he can be,” Patterson said. “He’s only just starting to get better.” But without the leadership and the consistent play of Brown, who has NFL scouts coming to Cal Poly to watch video tape, the secondary wouldn’t be where it is now. Both Lombardi brothers said that Brown adds inspiration and leadership to the team. Just showing little tricks on the field that James didn’t know before help him improve his game every day. With the second half of the season starting Saturday at Southern Utah, the secondary looks to make an impression. They want to be considered as the best secondary in the AWC. “We’re pretty confident that well be the best in the AWC,” David said. The Big Sky Conference on Hiesday accepted the bids by California State-Sacramento and California State-Northridge to join the league. The conference’s Presidents Council voted unanimously to make the universities members-elect. Theyll begin competing in the conference next year. The Big Sky will then grow to a nine-member conference. Portland State, admitted last May, will join the conference, while Boise State and the University of Idaho will leave for the Big West Conference in July. Big Sky Commissioner Doug Fullerton said a committee had visited both campuses and the presidents there had agreed to meet certain requirements. “While we plan to have all three schools begin play as early as 1996, this has become somewhat tricky because of the existing contracts the schools have with other institutions,” Fullerton said. \"It was logical for the league to expand into California, allowing us to enjoy quality conference competi* tion in a way that makes geographical sense.\" cil, said the continuing conference members are enthusiastic. “This will be good for the Big Sky and provide stability,” said Drummond, president of Eastern Washington University. “It was logical for the league to expand into California, allowing us to enjoy quality conference competition in a way that makes geographical sense,” he said. Fullerton said that with the league’s 60-plus scholarship base, “... both Sacramento and Northridge will be very competitive in football, much like they already are in other sports.” After the changes next summer, the Big Sky will include Portland State, Northridge, Sacramento, Eastern Washington, Idaho State, Montana, Montana State, Northern Arizona and Weber State.

Please send resume I Archlects, A new defensive system that includes three new defensive backs has dramatically changed Cal Poly’s secondary — for the better. It improved from a secondary that gave up just over 300 yards a game last year, to one that allowed no more than 200 yards in its hrst three games this year. This turnaround didn’t surprise coach Andre Patterson. He knew the capabilities of the secondary. Furthermore, Patterson said the gap is misleading to a degree because last year’s statistics do not adequately reflect the secondary. *It’s funny that pass defense always gets put on the secondary guys, but there’s more involved in being successful against the pass,” Patterson said. \"The rush that you get from defensive line and the second phase is what kind of coverage you're getting from the linebackers.” At the start of the season there was speculation about the secondary. Could they stand tough against Big Sky opponents? Could they redeem themselves after last season? The Mustangs have gone a long way toward putting those doubts to rest with solid numbers. Excluding Cal Poly’s game against Weber State when the Mustangs allowed 522 receiving yards, the secondary has erased the *We know what we need to do,” said sophomore safety Demetrius Davis. ”We’ve had a lot of speculation about us and I think we’ve proved them wrong.” Against NAIA opponent Western Montana, Cal Poly shut down junior Jason Truman, regarded as one of the best quarterbacks at the NAIA level, holding him to only 174 yards. One week later, the secondary shut down Idaho State. And after that, Montana State. *We wanted to be a respectable secondary,” said sophomore defensive back James Lombardi. *Last year we didn't get a lot of respect.” Lombardi and his brother Dave have added heart to the secondary, and their play at the ends of the field has earned them high praise. Dave was awarded the American West Defensive Player of the Week, after picking off Montana State’s quarterback and leading the Mustangs with seven tackles. ”Y)U always want to show you brother what you’ve got, along with the rest of the world,” David said. For senior safety David Brown, who is unanimously regarded as the leader of the secondary, gaining respect is not an issue. ”We know how good we were and how good we can be,” Brown said. ”We didn't really listen to that stuff too much.”",
