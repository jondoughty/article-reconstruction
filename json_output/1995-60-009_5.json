    "article_text": "The 1996 primary election in March may seem far away, but prospective candidates will soon begin pounding the pavement for registered voter signatures. Because California is a \"big swing-vote state,” its primary is a month earlier than in previous years, said Craig Driver, San Luis Obispo County elections clerk. In the past, California’s votes were among the last to get tallied, he said. But this year, the state’s primary is one of the first. In a 1994 California State Senate bill, the March primary became enacted into law. The new primary election date was passed on a trial period and will be effective until Jan. 1, 1998, unless another law repeals or extends it. In preparation for the primary, campaigning will begin early as well, l^e first step in this year’s political joust is candidates’ declaration of intent to run for office. Next, most applicants will tiy to get their candidacy filing fee waived. Credit toward the fee, which amounts to 1 percent of the candidate’s salary, is earned at the rate of 44 cents per valid signature. Candidates can start accumulating signatures Oct. 21 to Nov. 29, Driver said. Congresswoman Andrea Seastrand (R-Calif.) will need over 3,000 registered voter’s signatures to get her $1,336 fee waived,” he said. Perspective congressional opponent Walter Capps, who lost to Seastrand last year by less than a 1 percent margin, plans to run again and is already formulating his campaign strategy. Capps, a religious studies professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara for the past 30 years, attributed his approximate 1,500-vote defeat to his late start in the race. He did not begin campaigning until February 1994. lb combat last year’s campaign setbacks, Capps has already made a few low-profile visits to Cal Poly’s campus in order to make his name known to students. Capps plans on making several highly-publicized visits to Pbly within the next few weeks. Another candidate who plans on speaking to prospective student voters is Tbm Bordonaro. Bordonaro will lecture to several Cal Pbly business classes on Oct. 4. Although campaigning is well on its way, the 1996 campaign issues are still unclear. It will depend on the presidential election issues and what Congress accomplishes in welfare and Medicare and Medicaid reform,” Capps said. Capps, who favors Medicare reform, feels that the Republican party is not giving FVesident Clinton legislation he will be able to approve. The way the Republicans are going about it is deceptive,” he said. Integrity clearly remains the issue.” Capps aims to \"re-create the bond of trust between the people and Washington, D.C.” He urges voters to vote for what they hope will be accomplished not the lesser of two evils. Balancing the budget is the top priority for incumbent Seastrand, according to her press secretary Stuart Roy. In Congress, Seastrand believes she is doing the right things,” Roy said. Her first priority is reducing the deficit to spur economic growth, which would in turn create more jobs, Roy said. Therefore, she is in Washington, D.C. working on Medicare reform and will not begin campaigning until January. Since April, she had three town meetings in San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Santa Maria targeted toward senior citizen constituents, he said. Once constituents realized that Medicare reform was neces-___________See\tCAMRMGN poge 5 ■ary to prevent bankruptcy by the year 2002, they were open to give suggestions on reform. The meetings allowed Seastrand to go before Congress and share her constituents’ concerns for having a choice of doctors and health care options, Roy ■aid. Seastrand has also represented the voice of other Central Coast concerns throughout the year. Over the last year Seastrand has restored $2 million to the National Marine Sanctuary Program to protect the Channel Islands in Santa Barbara. She also lobbied the federal government to reimburse California for the costs of housing convicted illegal aliens in state facilities. Although the early primary affects Congressional candidates and state politicians, local government is not affected by the new primary legislation. Local campaigning will be handled in the following ways: *\tThe mayor and the board of supervisors do not have a municipal primary election so their campaigning is not expected to begin until the summer of 1996. •\tCalifornia’s two Senate' ■eats are not up for re-election iintil 2000.",
