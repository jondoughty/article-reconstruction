    "article_text": "Although the drive-in has been an American ritual for more than 30 years, its future is uncertain. There are only 2,000 drive-in theaters left in the United States today, a sharp reduction from the all-time high of nearly 5,000 in the 1950s. Larry Rodkey, owner of the only operating drive-in in San Luis Obispo County, the Sunset Drive-In, said drive-in disappearance is caused by many factors. \u201cThe land that drive-ins take up is the major reason you won\u2019t see any more drive-ins going up,\u2019\u2019 Rodkey said. \u201cThe owners of the land find it much more profitable to put in shopping centers. Also, people prefer to go to walk-in theaters because they can get better sound quality and a better picture on their screen.\u201d Herb Gunn, manager of Fremont Iheatre, said 75 percent of the drive-ins that existed in the past five years are gone. \u201cBecause of expanding land values, it\u2019s just not feasible for the owners of the land to use it for a drive-in any more,\u201d Gunn said. Another problem drive-ins face is getting first-run, top-quality Hollywood movies from the major distributors, which usually go to the big movie chains such as Mann theaters. \u201cThe thing with film is that when a theater buys a picture, they have to put up a bid,\u201d Rodkey said. \u201cAround here the Festival Cinema usually wins because they can afford to put up the most money.\u201d Rodkey said the reason theaters such as Mission Cinemas, Fremont Theatre, Festival Cinemas and Madonna Plaza charge the usual $5 for a movie, while other theaters such as Fair Oaks and the Bay Theatre can show movies for less, is because the big theaters have to pay a high price to get a first-run movie, while smaller theaters have to wait until it\u2019s played everywhere else before they can show it. \u201cThe first-run theaters have to charge the $5 just to pay for the movie they get,\u201d Rodkey said. \u201cThe smaller theaters like the Fair Oaks and the Bay Theatre have to pay a percentage of what they make on the movie after it\u2019s played everywhere else. The same applies here at Sunset. We have to pay back 35 percent of the gross we make. That\u2019s why there are numbers on every ticket, so we can account for everyone who comes in.\u201d Rodkey said his father first opened the Sunset Drive-In in 1950. He remembers it was raining heavily outside the night it opened, and they had it filled, with a line all the way from the box office to Higuera Street. \u2018\u2018There used to be a time when owning a drive-in was fun, but not anymore\u201d Rodkey said. \u2018\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for the swap meet here on Sunday, I probably wouldn\u2019t be in business. People just don\u2019t come out to the drive-in like they used to.\u201d Rodkey said he has been associated with movies since he was 8 years old. \u2018\u2018My parents owned the Fair Oaks Theater in Arroyo Grande for many years. I got to see a lot of the projection.\u201d Rodkey was the first manager to open Festival Cinemas, and currently helps manage Mission Cinemas. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve been associated with just about every movie theater in this area,\u201d he said. \u2018\u2018If there is anything 1 don\u2019t know I\u2019d be surprised,\u201d he joked. Despite the decline of the drive-in, Rodkey said he hopes to keep his doors open. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d hate to see the day when the drive-in doesn\u2019t exist. It will be a sad day when the drive-in is no longer a part of American life.\u201d",
