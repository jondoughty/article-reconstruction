    "article_text": "A once potentially dangerous toxic waste dump in Poly Canyon now poses \"no particular problem” to people or the environment, according to Cal Poly’s environmental health and safety officer. Donald Van Acker said a number of chemicals were found disposed in the area in 1976, such as metals and acids which he said could “leech into the ground water, or a creek” and threaten the city’s drinking water. Not only could people’s health be harmed by this, but the plant life in Poly Canyon would be hurt by the strong acidic water, ^ said. The dump site was once used by various campus departments and personnel, and was open to the general public from the early 1970's until about 1976. No records were kept of what went into the facility. Van Acker said. Last summer, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, and the state Health and Environmental Health Boards conducted tests at the dumpsite. The boards found the environment “stable and without leeching probims,” according to Van Acker. He said water testing is still being conducted in the area by the Water Quality Control Board. The board had to wait for a heavy rain season for the water level to be high in order to have accurate tests. Van Acker said the results should be in his office within a couple of months.",
