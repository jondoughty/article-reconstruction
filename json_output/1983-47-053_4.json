    "article_text": "Food is a word that is easily digested by most Cal Poly students. '' Yet many donâ€™t realize that the nutrition education program at the Health Center is designed to help them get the most out of what they eat. â€œWe are an information service,â€ said Brenda Groves, supervisor of nutrition education. â€œWe want to help students become in tune with tliemselves and their bodies.â€ The program involves one-to-one counseluig sessions with 12 nutrition educators available daily from 9 a.m. to noon. 'The student decides the subject to be discussed, but the program specializes in weight loss and gain, on-campus dining halls, nutrition for athletes, basic nutrition, consumerism and vegetarianism. â€™There is also a weekly weight control support group from 7 to 8 p.m. on We^esdays. â€œEighty percent of the students that come in are in for weight loss,â€ Groves said. Once a student has filled out an assessment form, an educator will put the student on a program or diet that fits his or her individual needs. â€œThe assessment form tells us why an individual eats what he eats,â€ said Maryanne Painter, nutrition educator. â€œIt covers everything from family background to favorite foods.â€ â€™The student is also given a commitment card if he or she is involved in a specialized program. The card is designed to be a motivator: On it are short-term goals for the week that the student and educator have chosen. â€™The nutrition education program has been at Cal Poly for five years. All of the educators are volunteer dietetics majors. While many of the budget cuts that Governor Deukmejian has ordered are frightening and unfair, that lack of appropriation of funds sufficient to ke^ Cal Poly in session during the summer, in addition to the former chargee, is downright stupid. It is true that taking Cal Poly out of function during the summer quarter would serve as an immediate cost reduction, but what would the consequences of this be. Today, many Cal Poly students do not plan to use only the traditional four times three quarters to graduate. The summer sessions, however, have so far provided an excellent opportunity for students to graduate within four years an3rway. If that opportunity is removed, many students will have to delay their graduations and thereby stay longer in the facility. The result heraof hardly constitute any savings per student although, of course, it will mean that there will be room for less new students. At a university that is already impacted, I wonder if anyone in his right mind could justify this. Another question is that of efficiency and appropriate utilization of the facilities and equipment that the university possesses uid will continue to possess over the summer. Considering the fact that majors such as computer sdsnee are greatly impacted, the facilities in these dq>artments should be used to their fullest. Of course, the sight of an â€œemptyâ€ campus over the summer would also be a heartbreaking one. Finally, it seems that the timing of the consideration to cancel the summer quarter is very irresponsible. 0>nsider-ing the fact that many students have to plan ahead, a five and a half month warning is clearly insufficient. Then again, who knew that we would get Deukmejian as governor? I urge all concerned students and faculty members to write Goveri^r George Deulanejian (State Capitol, Sacramento. CA 96814) and ask that sufficient funds be reinstated to maintain the sununar quarter. Part of these funds might be obtained by selling the Governorâ€™s mansion. Then again, we all have different priorities.",
