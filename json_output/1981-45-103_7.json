    "article_text": "Incoming students in the future may better understand the Cal Poly police and other governmental agencies after reading the student community resource handbook. The goal of the pamphlet, currently being planned by the coordinator of the student afftrmatiye action program on campus. Alfonso E. Locke, is to improve student-community involvement. Community and governmental agencies, and individuals who lead these agencies, would be covered_ in one section of the pam-~ phlet. “The campus police is just one example,” said Locke. He feels students need to know more than the phone number of the department, including how the police perceive students, what problems they have with students and how relationships between the two groups can be improved. Off-campus housing would also be a major part of the pamphlet, showing what apartment complexes are accessible to disabled or handicapped students. In another section of the handbook, Locke wants to provide students with consumer services information, such as inexpensive places to get hair cut, plus banks, shopping and specialty stores. local and long distance buslines, airlines and commuter sharing will also be covered. Recreation information is also important, said Locke. City, county and state parks, and their descriptions and locations can be reported on, along with the maintainance which must be done to keep them up. Performing arts, cultural organizations and leisure time pursuits, like movies, newspapers, radio stations and television, would be developed in another sec- tion, according to Locke. Locke wants older students to write arid complete the pamphlet because \"they can give their opinions of the advantages, disadvantages and highlights of the community outside of the classroom as they see it through their experience.” About 25 volunteers are needed to get this handbook started on its way to reality, said Locke. He suggests that students interested in graphic arts, photography, writing, cartoons, illustrations or any type of artwork contact him. Locke wants to recruit a four-member coordii^ting committee to direct and review the activities and articles written by other student volunteers. \"There is a strong possibility of reimbursement for volunteer time spent,” said Locke, and he is willing to leave the work schedule up to individual students. If anyone is interested, contact Locke at 546-1436 of Room 35-Q in the Facul-> ty Office Building.",
