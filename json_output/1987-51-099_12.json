There would be talk, some joking (perhaps aimed at the KGB), a generous helping of steaming borscht and a few good belts of vodka. Yep, that’s what it would be like. At least that’s probably how a lot of Americans see the Soviet Union — like a scene out of the movie “Moscow on the Hudson.’’ Likewise, many Soviets probably see the United States as one big slum. Tattered buildings pack the streets like a crowded elevator and give meager shelter to masses of homeless — the victims of an exploitative capitalistic system. Those are the types of films the Soviet government broadcasts. The truth is, neither country’s citizens, on the whole, have a comprehensive view of the “other side of the fence.’’ After all, said Cal Poly professor of Russian culture Bianca Rosenthal, Soviets aren’t supposed to make contact with foreigners. The Soviet government doesn’t want its people to know what Americans have that Soviets don’t, she added. So not only are Soviet citizens “discouraged’’ from making contact with foreigners, but foreigners, Americans in particular, are “discouraged’’ from rubbing elbows with the natives. One Cal Poly student got a taste of Soviet life in the summer of 1985, though he admits the weekend trip to the “tourist trap’’ of Leningrad in western Russia left him little insight into the lives and thoughts of the Soviet people. Joe Flatley, a 20-year-old sophomore, flew to Finland to meet his girlfriend and the two hopped on a Finnish tour bus into Leningrad. Most of the Fins on the trip only crossed the border to get drunk, the same reason many Americans go to Tijuana, Flatley said. While most Fins on the tour seemed content to stay in the hotel and drink vodka, Flatley hit the streets and began piecing together his impressions of Russia. “Before I went in there (on the bus),’’ he said, “I had a lot of opinions about Russia.” But these preconceptions were later changed by what he saw there. At first, he said, all he saw was army bases and military trucks that made it seem like he was “walking into a big trap ... It felt like the farther I got in — it’s not like I felt in danger — it was just a strange feeling,” he remembers. “It felt like kind of a taboo for an American to go in there. Really pretty countryside, though. Nice drive.” Flatley said he was paid extra attention by the KGB because he was American. They went through all his bags and quizzed him on his ID. He also couldn’t bring his camera in with him. Conversation was one-track at times, when people he talked with dug into their English repertoire. They all seemed to know the phrases, “Do you have sports clothes?” and “Do you have Nike?” “They all could ask me if I had blue jeans,” he said. “I sold a pair. I needed the money.” The incident he mentioned involved a woman in the hotel where he was staying. She dragged him into a dark room, he said, where they haggled over the price for a pair of Levi’s. Flatley sold them to her for $40. “I could have gotten $50, but I would have felt too guilty.” Aside from typical blue jean-centered conversations, Flatley noticed that people of different age groups reacted to him dif- ferently\tafter they\tfound\tout\the\twas American. Middle generation Russians seemed interested in meeting him and talking with him, he said. So were women, but the males his age and younger “got hostile”\twhen they\tfound\tout\the\twas American. “Some (people) were scared to talk to you, seems like,” he said. Others seemed interested but wouldn’t approach him. “There are some good-looking girls there,” he quickly added. Flatley said the natives “probably thought the tourists were jerks,” and that Leningrad by no means represents the rest of the Soviet Union.\t“I’m\tsure\tif you go out in the\tcountryside it\twould be dif- ferent,” he said. One stereotype that happens to be true is that Soviets spend a lot of time standing in line for food and other needs. “There was\tthe meat\tstore\tand\ta big line in front of\tthat, and\tthere\twas\tthe bread store and a big line in front of that and there was the vegetable store and a big line in front of that!” he said. One thing that bothered Flatley, though, was that the stores would put him at the front of the line because he was American. “People didn’t say anything,” he said. “They just stared.” Despite the military cars and taxis speeding and swerving chaotically through the streets and obeying no traffic laws (because there aren’t any), Flatley was impressed by the beauty of the architecture in the clean but colorless city. The Catholic Russian Orthodox church “was the hugest, most immense church I’ve ever seen in my life,” he said. “There was gold everywhere — a lot of statues and paintings, and a lot of old ladies would walk around to each and say a little prayer and kiss it ... and you couldn’t touch anything unless you were an old lady,” he joked. What Flatley did regret, though, was that he hadn’t spent a lot of time talking to the Russian people. He would love to sit down to dinner with a Soviet family, learn about them, tell them about America, and perhaps down a few shots of vodka. “But obviously I didn’t get a chance to do that,” he said. Professor Rosenthal, though, said the Soviet Union is loosening up a bit. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s recent policy of openness is changing things rapidly in Russia and the rest of the USSR, Rosenthal said. Gorbachev’s move to create more work initiative and even small family businesses might allow Soviets to meet more foreigners and learn about America through Americans rather than just literature. “1 think there’s a good chance (for it to happen), but that remains to be seen,” she said. Rosenthal will teach on the London Study Program, in which students will take a trip into the Soviet Union. Rosenthal and others will try for more contact betweeen Americans and Soviet citizens. “Though group efforts to meet Soviets may not work, students talking to Soviets on their own might be more successful,” she said. “The trip will certainly be worthwhile. That’s what everyone’s said who has gone there. It makes them more aware of the world we live in.” Rosenthal said students on London Study will probably find what her students in the Russian culture class and Flatley have found — that the Soviets are people, quite a bit like them.",
