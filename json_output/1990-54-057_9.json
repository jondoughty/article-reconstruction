Christopher Bradbury, John Butler and Tracy Westnedge, who felt the business department needed a more specialized seminar, planned “The New Age of Human Resource Management” conference. The conference is sponsored by the School of Business, and will take place Feb. 2, from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Shore Cliff Lodge in Pismo Beach. Human resource management “is a growing field, and it’s going to be more important in the next decade,” said Westnedge. “We want to make it a little bit more well known.” Working in the Alumni Relations Office, the students began the project in September by searching the data base of more than 8,000 business alumni to find panelists experienced in personnel or resource management departmants of large- or medium-sized companies. Other experts were found through acquaintances and inquiries. More than 100 students, businessmen and local representatives are expected to turn out for the event. “It’s generating quite a bit of interest on and off campus,” said Stephen L. Hughes, from alumni relations for the School of Business. Several banks and local agencies are also planning to send teams to the conference. If the senior project is sue Sec CONFERENCE, page 8",
