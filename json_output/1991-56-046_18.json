    "article_text": "The Cal Poly Mustangs have soared thus far after winning their first four contests this season. In the euphoria of the referendum decision. Cal Poly athletics received more good news. Both the men’s and women’s swimming teams are ranked No. 3 in Division II by a preseason top-10 poll of the College Swim Coaches Association of America. The ranking is the highest Poly’s swim teams have ever had, said Cal Poly’s Head Coach Rich Firman. Firman accounts this largely to a g(x>d share of returning memlx'rs and new recruits despite the “uneasy” times before the referendum decision. “We’ve got a lot of returning juniors and sophomores and, surprisingly, with the referendum, we had a good recruiting year,” Firman said. “We have a transfer who is a U.S. Open qualifier in the 50-meter freestyle, and we drew in two high sch(X)l All-Amer*ican recruits.” Firrnan said they have a returning team that placed second in the nationals’ 800-meter free relay. He said one of the returning students, swim team captain Jeremy Brannon, placed in the U.S. Open. The team also has returning national champion swim team captain Stephanie Keller. Keller, a liberal studies junior, is in her third year on the team. She was pleased with the recent polls and sized up this year as having a “solid team with a lot of good people on it.”",
