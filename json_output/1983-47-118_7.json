    "article_text": "Calculators and mechanical pencils are sharing space lately with literary masterpieces in the backpacks of some Cal Poly engineering majors. They are men and women with technical majors going for something extra in the English department minor program. Approximately one-third of the 65 English minors at Cal Poly are engineering majors, according to Michael Orth, coordinator and advisor for the year-old program. Sometimes the load of 27 additional units costs those students an extra quarter or two, but for a variety of reasons they feel the investment of time and effort is worth it. classes are a refreshing change.” Then, too, there is the potential career leverage the minor might give an engineering major. \"The English minor may also give students more flexibility in their profession,\" said Orth. \"TTiere is a problem with illiteracy in business and industry. There is room for people who can write a report or make sense of what others may have written.\" Robert Valpey, Dean of the School of Engineering and Technology, agrees with Orth. \"In any and every business. including engineering, the need for communication skills stands out as absolutely essential for advancing in one's career,\" said Valpey. \"Where an English minor may aid in honing those communiction skills, then it is indeed a valuable thing to have,\" he said. The course requirements within the English minor Food in the library can cause damage to books and eventually lead to expensive fumigation. English: a minor for all mayors includes Shakespeare, American and Victorian literature, advanced composition and English grammar. ' The program, which started winter quarter of 1982, is drawing about 20 sign-ups each quarter, but Orth said he’d be happy to see 200 more in the program. At least three of the engineering majors see the career benefits and the change of pace from their major as reasons for minor-ing in English. Roger Hand, a senior Electronic Engineering major said he became aware of the minor program through posters in the English building. \"1 looked at the classes 1 would have to take, and found out I would have taken most of them out of interest anyway. If I wasn't interested in English in the first place, I Students eating habits cause many problems for the library, the director of the Robert E. Kennedy Library said. David Walch said crumbs left by snacking students attract silverfish: small wingless insects. If students mix food into books while studying, silverfish may move into the books and generate, he said. This requires expensive fumigation to correct. Libraries take many steps to preserve their collections such as a controlled climate. Walch said food mixed in with books multiplies the problem of deterioration. Library furniture also falls victim to student dining. Students often spill coffee and other drinks on the couches and carpet in the library, Walch said. He said students also stick chewing gum under table tops and in cracks between couch cushions. Students eating while studying abuse library books outside of the library as well. Walch said the worst case of food stains he has seen at Cal Poly was a book which had been returned laced with ketchup. Students have gone far in breaking library rules against consuming food there. One student ordered a pizza and had it delivered to the library, he said. — Walch said students tend to eat in the library more in the evening, but eating starts in the morning with cups of coffee brought into the building. Students can solve the problems of food damage to library facilities best by doing their eating outside of the library, Walch said. to finish their food outside or to throw it away, he said. \"Fortunately I’ve never encountered a student who did not cooperate when confronted with the problem,\" Walch said. \"If there was an attitude of belligerence, we would call security. The size of the library makes food control difficult, Walch added. With five stories and 2,300 student study spots, a full-time employee would be needed to police the library, he said. Walch said the library staff tries to catch people with food as they enter the library, but with an average of 5,000 students entering each day, stopping the majority of violators is doubtful. Walch said he would welcome a student volunteer group to help supervise but has not planned such a group as of yet. With 5,000 gallons of milk and over 400 pounds of cheese being processed every week, the Cal Poly Dairy Processing Plant is certainly a busy little place. The plant is operated by 25 students, 23 are Dairy Manufacturing majors, and supervised by two foremen and one general manager. The plant handles all the Foundation’s milk and byproducts, fills orders from Williams Brothers markets, and stocks the shelves of the campus store. The students work part-time between classes, and have weekends off. Their typical day begins t 6 a.m., but Mondays they must report to work by 4:30 a.m. \"By 2 o’clock you are nodding off in your classes,\" according to Randall Dei, one of the foremen of the plant. Dei will be graduating next fall and has a job this summer working for Lucky’s Fluid Milk Plant, but for now he spends most of his time helping to oversee operations of the Cal Poly plant. Monday, Wednesday and Friday the plant is in full operation processing fluid milk. “After the milk comes down from the dairy it is stored in stainless steel tanks which hold 2,000 gallons of milk,” Dei said. The milk is picked up from the dairy every other day. The milk is then drawn out of the tanks and standardized to 3.5 percent milkfat. \"To do this, cream is drawn off the top. Then the cream is used to make other things, like butter,” Dei noted. \"The milk is pasteurized at 161 degrees for 15 seconds. From there it is put into the tiller which puts it into cartons or bags,” Dei said. Discovering educational concepts in the physical environment, and designing effective learning environments was the topic of a slide-illustrated talk presented here Thursday by Dr. Anne Taylor, a professor of art education and architecture at the University of New Mexico. For the last 15 years Taylor has worked to \"marry education with architecture.\" That is, she considers architecture a medium to teach ideas. In her work designing schools, Taylor pays close attention to the learning needs of children, incorporating educational concepts into every aspect of the structure and the objects tlut fill it. In an optimal learning environment, Taylor said, the doors, lighting, furnishings, even the walls \"represent some of the concepts that conte right out of the curriculum that we teach from textbooks.” One illustration of this was a slide showing a snaall cubicle with mirrors on all four inside walls. It is an art center where children draw their likeness on the mirror by tracing over their image. Taylor said the children are able to draw with great detail this way and she found improvement in later artwork. The mirrored space also presents the difficult concept of infinity in a way children can see. Round forms are used as much as possible in the play areas Taylor designs because, she said, they permit eye contact and promote socialization. To implement some of her ideas would cost more than to build a standard elementary schoolroom, but Taylor also utilizes often overlooked learning tools that are part of any schoolroom. For example, thousands of dollars are spent every year on teaching aids that show children how various mechanical systems work. Taylor’s philosophy is to uncover some of those systems, such as plumbing and heating, so the students could learn by simply looking at the exposed pipe system. Another design that Taylor said has been very successful in two ways is a solar greenhouse. Children, who are egocentric, learned to nurture life outside themselves in the greenhouse. The circulating heat system, she added, provided a good comparison to teach ttem about their own circulatory systems. “Children learn a great many things by themselves,” Taylor said, “but the environment must be well designed and optimally provisioned.” I wu UsUiiiiig to • now« broadcast about our invohramant in Latin Amarica tbs othar night, whan I raaWaart that parhaps tha biggsst raaaon wa art down than is that wa simply don’t aaa the «mflict through tha ayes of those who ^va in tha region. Our administration does not understand that tha ptoblams in Latin America atom from the desire of an oppressed people to win their ri^t to a fidl belly. This inability to view the world as others do causes obvious political pto-blsms. Our laadars seam unable to stay out of distant aituationa they do not. understand. But this problem also effects our personal life because of the blunders and assumptions ws make ' with lovers and frimds. Before we can.expect our leaders to view the world with a lass jaundiced eye we as individuals must have this ability ourselves. I don’t pretend to possess this ability to any great extant, but I remember one time when I did see the world through the eyesof a friend, I learned a valued lesson. It was the summer of 1976, and we were both working in an iron foundry in Loe Angolas. We worked on the pouring crew, transfaring the molton iron from a huge laddie into molds as big as a Volkswagan Bug. It was a hot. miaarahlaan^dangarous Job. Besidss Ilia tact we both hated our jobal my friend, and I had almost notUng in common; ha was black and from tha ghetto, I was from tha suburbs and was ths only Caucasian In tha plant. Wa had a good faisndahip baasd on our woifr. Wa iohad tog^hsr and worked wnl togathar, trying to make an ahnoat unbaarabls job a BtUs saaiar. But our friendship neves went outsids of ths irbn foundry. I was often confused by his attitudes on Ufa, and tho«^ I Ubsd him I was shocked to learn that he occasionally would pull a “stick up“ just to get some extra money. When he asked me for a ride home, one day, Lgot an opportunity to see the world as hie did. and to undmtand his views a little better. He lived in Compton, in a run-down, black neighborho^. ’There was a number of abandoned cars' in ths strwts, and garbage in the gutters. Hm homes looked old a^ worn out. As wa pulled Into his driveway ha recognixea my growing discomfort. “Now you know how I foal in Whitey's world, don’cha?\" ha said. I told him I couldn’t really know how he felt, but that I got the point. Thara eras not a whita faca around, and I Mt uncomfbrtabla. “Ya know, it woun’t ba too bad if it want fo tha tuba man.\" “What ths haD has talsvision got to do arith anything?’’ I askad incredulous- “Whsnsvar I turn on tha tuba I saa Whitey,” he said quistly, “Whitey alwajrs look good, nica clothaa. nice house, plenty o’ bread...” Ha gave nm a hard look, “you aaa any o’ that sUt around hare?” I watched in silence as he got out of the car. cloeed the door ami walked toward his house. Down ths stipat there was a Itttla girl plasring jump-ropa in front of a bumad-out building, an old lady draasad in rags carrying a grocery bag and a drunk sitting on the curb with his head between his knees. “No.” I said to myself as my fHsnd entered hie houae. “no. I don’t see any of that shit around here.”",
