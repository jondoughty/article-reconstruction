    "article_text": "After less than a full year of operation, the ASI Children’s Center found itself last July more than $200,000 in debt. Since then, many have been left wondering just where it went wrong. For those who have sorted through the finances, it’s clear: planners expected to have it all — full occupancy and the fees that come along with it. The Center also was dependent on high enrollment and a portion of the ASI fees each student pays. But university enrollment has decreased and the Center has not filled with children. Last month, the ASI Board of Directors approved refinancing of the Center’s $1.2 million loan, hoping to control damages from runaway debts The move — which extends the repayment period over 20 instead of 10 years — will decrease annual interest payments by $70,000. According to ASI Interim Executive Director Polly Harrigan, the refinancing is just the latest step in reorganizing the Center’s budget since its $200,000 deficit was reviewed in July 1993. Both Harrigan and ASI Vice President for Finance Shawn Reeves said the Children’s Center forecasting was flawed in assuming too high a number of students would be on campus paying ASI fees and putting their children in the daycare facility. Reeves said the basis of these problems, as well as others, was poor planning on ASI’s part. “When we made the financial projections (for the new Center), enrollment was higher at the Center and the university,” Reeves said. “Once the operational realities kind of set in, we realized that the Center’s enrollment goals were too high and that we were not going to meet it now or in the future.” The goal of ASI was to maintain the Center’s occupancy rate at 100 percent throughout the school year. Yet in July 1993 it was clear that the Center could not achieve that goal. “Last year our occupancy rate was fluctuating between 60 to 70 percent a quarter,” she said. “We now understand that our goal of 100 percent was unrealistic and are preparing a budget for next year that will allow See CHILDREN’S CENTER, page 5 us to meet our financial obligations.“ Reeves said ASI has based the Center’s 1994-95 budget projections around an 86 percent occupancy rate in hopes of balancing its loudget. “I think it’s something that is definitely attainable, but the Center will have to make this budget in order to make next year work.” 'The budget problem doesn’t just affect the Children’s Center. Because of the money the Center has lost, ASI has made cutbacks in other programs and has instituted a hiring freeze throughout the corporation. “ASI has left a couple of job positions vacant in order to help the Center meet this year’s budget,” Harrigan said. “This basically means that we haven’t hired any nonstudent staff since we found about the deficit.” According to Reeves, ASI has limited the funds given to the Program Board and Instructional Related Activities. “In order to save the Center, ASI has issued a moratorium of Program Board events in excess of $7,500,” he said. “We also were not able to grant an extra $20,000 to other ASI organizations such as the Cal Poly Crew or the MEChA club.” ASI isn’t the only one that’s had to sacrifice. Employees at the Center also have made several changes in efforts to ease the burden of the deficit. Children’s Center Director Haila Hafley said the Center is making drastic changes with assistance from employees, parents, ASI and other departments on campus. With help from Campus Dining and the Nutrition and Food Science departments, the Center has learned how to control food preparation costs. The Center also is making cutbacks within the organization. High staffing costs have been among the biggest contributors to the deficit, and the Center managers say they already are addressing those. “We have decided to eliminate one classroom and limit the amount of children per classroom in order to keep our child-teacher ratio low,” Hafley said. “We realize that some of our cutbacks are small, but every lit- tie bit helps,” she added. “These changes will alter the Center in some ways, but we are determined to provide the high quality care we always have.” According to Hafley, the Center also has made cuts in personnel areas that would least effect the program. These cutbacks include a small decrease in student starting pay along with limited pay increases. The Center also has eliminated one office manager position in hopes of decreasing all unnecessary costs. “In conjunction with these changes we have increased parent fees by a minimal amount,” Hafley said. “And we now are recruiting volunteers to help in classrooms, kitchen and office areas in hopes to reduce student staff hours.\" Agricultural science senior Jennifer Raia said as an employee of the Center she feels the program is too important to lose and supports all the changes. “We don’t have as much as we did before, but we need to save the Center because it has too many wonderful things to offer the children, parents, students, and the university,” she said.",
