    "article_text": "Cal Poly’s new dean of the School of Business, Bill Boyes, challenged members of a local women’s organization with some enlightening political beliefs during a lecture Monday evening. With alarming statistics and fiery words, Boyes praised privatization and criticized the growth of governmental regulations and controls in America. “What we are doing doesn’t make any sense,” Boyes said emphatically to the Five Cities-Pismo Beach Branch of the American Association of University Women. “We need to break the strangle hold of governmental control.” Specifically, Boyes singled out the governmental regulations on small businesses in California. “Californians, there is a potential for losing what you have!” Boyes said. Although California could be called the eighth-largest country in the world, this state is losing many small businesses each year. “In California there is an antientrepreneur, anti-newcomer attitude with its ‘welcome stranger’ taxes, water rationing,” Boyes said. The vast number of permits and regulations required for small businesses are making it impossible to make a living in California, he said. Thrning to the regulations and controls exercised by the government nationwide, Boyes pushed for more privatization. “Privatization doesn’t mean we get rid of it,” he said. “It just becomes more efficient.” He believes privatization of the Department of Motor Vehicles, garbage collection, building inspectors, prisons, roads and education would increase efficiency and reduce expenses. When questioned about the possibilities of toll roads, Boyes said, “Okay, we would pay tolls, but we are paying for something we are using.” In addition, Boyes believes the govern- ment should end farm subsidies. “The average farmer is a millionaire,” he said. He later clarified this statement, saying the assets and land plus the income earned equaled $1,000,000. Government spending in the tobacco industry was another mystery to Boyes. He questioned the logic behind allocating government money to tobacco subsidies, antismoking campaigns, cancer research, breast cancer research and then adding a cigarette tax. “We have got to demand the government treat us better,” Boyes said. “The government does a bad job of spending our money.” Sandy Miller, a member of AAUW, said she found Boyes’ lecture very interesting. “I just kind of realized how much the wool’s been pulled over our eyes from the media,” Miller said. “Yes (the economy) is down, but we’re on the rise. The reces- sion we had 10 years ago is worse than this one. “I found that encouraging and a bit of an eye-opener,” she said.",
