    "article_text": "Cal Poly students will have the opportunity to participate in a trial faculty evaluation survey during the ninth week of winter quarter. The survey will be distributed to students in two general education courses, said Geoff Austin, chairman of the Academic Commission. The courses targeted for the preliminary evaluations are Philosophy 231 and Political Science 210, which each have approximately 26 class sections, Austin said. “During the first few weeks of next quarter we will compile the surveys and put out our first course evaluation manual,” Austin said. The professors and depart- ment heads involved with these courses have received a copy of the survey from the Academic Commission, said Kristen Burnett, ASI Academic Coordinator. They have also received a letter requesting permission to distribute the surveys during class, Burnett said. “The surveys will be much more consistent and will have more integrity if they are administered in the classroom,” Burnett said. “We are doing this trial survey at the suggestion of (Academic Senate Chair) Charlie Andrews, Burnett said. “If we get a great deal of participation and positive feedback from the faculty, we’ll be able to present a favorable report to the Senate.” If the initial trial is successful, a “full-blown” course evalua- tion will be administered spring quarter and the results will be available to students fall quarter, Austin said. Members of the Board of Directors will be conducting interviews with various professors to give them an opportunity to voice their opinions on the evaluation, Burnett said. The professors will fill out a nine-question inquiry that will give the Academic Commission an idea of the concerns faculty members might have with evaluations, Burnett said. Professors have expressed concerns about the publication of subjective comments, such as comments on personal hygiene or personality conflicts, Burnett said. “Subjective comments will not Sec EVALl ATIONS, page H be published, but there is an area on the survey provided for comments and suggestions that only the professor will see,” said Burnett. The Academic Commission will most likely obtain the official evaluation survey from Educational Testing Services, Austin said. ETS is a national organization that publishes “the premier (survey) of its kind in this country,” said Roger Conway, ASI executive director. Research of ETS data which provides validity and reliability to the survey will be available to the Cal Poly faculty, Conway said. “Ailer students have completed the surveys, they will be sent back to ETS to be scored,” Burnett said. “This will ensure unbiased scoring.” “So far the response we’ve received from professors (to allow surveys in the classr(X)m) has been very positive,” said Burnett. The Academic Commission has also considered using UC San Diego’s faculty evaluation, Austin said. At Wednesday’s ASI Board of Directors meeting. President David Kapic congratulated the Academic Commission for its progress in efforts to develop a faculty evaluation program. “I really want to commend the leadership of the Academic Commission,” Kapic said. “Don’t underestimate how far they’ve come,” he said. “What they’re about to begin has been attempted for the last 10 years and has been unsuccessful up to this point.”",
