    "article_text": "I would like to praise the Mustang Daily for its openness to preseat all sides of an issue. The position of the Daily is to inform and stimulate its readers to think. The abortion cartoon last week was one such occasion. On Friday Ms. Trumbull wrote a letter blasting the Daily for printing the cartoon. She missed the very object of the cartoon, which is to stimulate thought. Just because of an unplanned pregnancy you don’t need to forego your goals. Many pregnant mothers and mothers with children attend Poly. To someone irresponsible enough to have sex unprotected, raising a child must seem an insurmountable task. The loss of a child by adoption is a hardship many mothers have to deal with. But 1 think it’s comforting to know your child is being cared for by someone who loves and wants it. The thought of your child lying dead in a garbage can behind some doctor’s office has little comfort. The way you lose a child says a lot about how you feel about the loss. Think about the opposing view. What about a child’s right to control its body? If you don’t agree, at least the cartoon caused you to think about it.",
