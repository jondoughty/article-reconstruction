The 21-year-old journalism major is what society has labeled a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpunker.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d But Morris doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel he's a punker. \u00e2\u20ac\u01531 call myself the average Cal Poly journalism student,\" he said. Morris sports a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmohawk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 type haircut and wears layered clothing typical of the 50\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wear dazzling earrings on his earlobes, nor does he wear tattered T-shirts that most everyone typecasts as what a punker should wear But still, Morris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appearances have shocked some people and have even caused others to take action against him. When Morris came to Cal Poly four years ago, he said he looked like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyoiir average regular high school student who was becoming a freshman \u00e2\u20ac\u009d Soon after entering Cal Poly, Morris went through a transformation in his life. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u02dc1 don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether it has to do with dorm-life breeding, though the one I was in was a zoo,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said. \"College turned out to be the whole difference High school was a sort of incubation period. In high school you basically knew everyone, you led a very stable lifestyle. Then in college, you hear all the myths about the different people, and you're out there living with them-it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Morris said. One of the major differences in Morris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 life was the style of music he began listening to. 1 was into every band in high school-Zeppelin, Van Halen, Aerosmith and Journey to name a few.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d He said. Mainly I was listening to them because everyone else was listening to them. Then a few bands caught my ear and I really liked what 1 was listening to.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d He began to listen to bands such as the Sex Pistols These hands, who were labeled punk rock, approached world concerns and questioned society. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They were addressing these problems, whereas the others were still singing about the same old stuff-all about love and how my baby left me and how I got my baby back,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Morris said. Soon after discovering these bands, Morris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 life was transformed. He got his haircut and slowly began to dress \u00e2\u20ac\u0153differently from others.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d He recalls, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I showed up at Cal Poly, 1 got the haircut. 1 could count the number of people who looked like me on two fingers.\" After the change in his lifestyle, Morris noticed a change in the attitudes of people on and off campus. Everyone just started staring at me as though 1- was a stranger. 1 don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think 1 was any different. 1 wasn't out to say screw you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to look different. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It just pleases me, \" he said. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t out to make any type of statement like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWell, here 1 am,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trying to please anyone but me. 1 liked it. It pleases me. Before I try to please or displease anyone,\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going tp please me. \u00e2\u20ac\u009d Morris said. He began to notice people stereotyping him. 1 couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why. When 1 first got the haircut and the clothes, people were very vocal. 1 couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say things like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyou godamn punker,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure that out. If I was walking down the street and saw the strangest person on the earth, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I would start calling them names.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Morris said he found many people who thought of his lifestyle as \"wild and crazy.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d You really get a lot of hypocritical analogy-stuff like punkers beat people up is one of the major stereotypes,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said, 1 can't say that it's not all true, but a lot of it isn't.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Morris recalls a time when a member from a motorcycle gang came up to him and began \u00e2\u20ac\u0153screaming in my ear about what he thought of me.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 He added, \"I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been pushed around because of the way I look, but my reaction to it is to act like it never happened. People are expecting a reaction- that I am going to fight back.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The number of people who have changed their lifestyle to that of a punker's has grown. Whether it's a fad or fashion, Morris doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. type of thing.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Because of his punk-lifestyle, Morris knows people view him differently. He knows that when he does start looking for a job things will be different. If I were to work on a newspaper or such. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure I would have to look the way a journalist is supposed to look,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said. It depends on the individual. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dislike what people do...it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their lifestyle,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said. People are seeing things out there, and some of them are there just foUowing-the-leader He added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be just as comfortable dressing in that way. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll still think the same, I realize that. I have even had instructors who have gone out of their way to tell me that I may have to conform. I lead a lifestyle, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to conform to the dress.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \"Most employers want to hire a nice, responsible person, and I guess responsible goes into the looks and dress,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Morris said. Although people think Morris seems strange because of his lifestyle, he said, \"I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel at all like a revolutionist\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthough I 've been blasted by a lot of people because of the way I look. People think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m strange, but I just think they look stranger, he add- ' ed. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying that what everyone elM is doing is wrong, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m doing is wrong either.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",
