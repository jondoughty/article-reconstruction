    "article_text": "Editor: One of the major issues that has been brought into the upcoming ASI election is the “parking problem.\" I ask the students at Cal Poly: Do we have a parking problem or an automobile problem? So far, the issue has been the creation of more parking, rather than the issue of eliminating the congestion, smog and confusion of the automobile. Every day 1 come to school (on my bicycle) and am inundated with far too many automobiles on campus. 1 have noticed that most of these cars contain only one person who, more likely than not, lives less than a rtiile away from campus. WHY? Creating more available parking would only encourage more people to use their cars. I say: I.et's not add more asphalt to our beautiful campus. Let's all work together to consolidate the number of cars on campus and eliminate the automobile problem There are many arguments for not building more parking: added cost to the university and students. depletion of land that could be put to other uses, not to mention the added traffic on campus. Fewer cars can be equated with less oil consumption. less smog, less congestion on campus, easier mobility for those using alternative transpor- tation (i.e. bicycles, walking, mopeds, buses), and people might get some exercise in the process I urge the candidates for ASI offices to take issue with the extension of parking on campus. Rather, be creative and push for new ideas to reduce the number of cars being driven to campus 1 have some suggestions:    , ^ •Convert parking closest to the inner-core of campus into car pool parking. Sell piermits for these areas at reduced rates. •Raise parking permit fees for those who live within the San Luis Obispo city limits. •Conduct promotion to en courage the use of alternative modes of transportaiion: Provide free concerts for those who do not drive to school; pass our buttons to those who ride bikes or walk to sRcool and conduct raffles each month for those people for some type of prize; put flyers on cars in the campus parking lots stating the advantages of not driving to school or car pool ing. •Provide rebates of .ASI fit--for those students who do n -: purchasse parking permil s 1 could go on, but rny point ; that there are many allernaliM-^ to the automobile probli'in besides building more parking I charge the candidates to take a stand against additional parking Let's not pave over the beauty that sets Cal Poly apart from other campuses.",
