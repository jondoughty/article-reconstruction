    "article_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Reagan, saying he’s bitter about former White House Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan’s “kiss and tell’’ book, has disclosed that he quietly prepared for his former aide’s departure for months before he left. The president, in an interview broadcast on Cable News Network on Monday, insisted, “There was no firing at all.” However, the president added that he planned to use a letter of resignation ™Regan had submitted months before. “1 set out at the same time, then, to start quietly, and hoping, leakproof, to have a successor on hand for when he announced the time he was going to go,” Reagan said. Reagan acknowledged in the interview that Regan had been having problems with Nancy Reagan, the first lady, and that one of his weaknesses as president is that “I know that I have a soft heart.” Regan, who had been Treasury secretary, and then-White House chief of staff James A. Baker III told the president they wanted to switch jobs in early 1985, and he approved the request. Regan left at the end of February 1987, at the height of the Iran-Contra scandal, and was replaced by former Sen. Howard Baker, R-Tenn. Reagan insisted at the time he did not fire Regan, saying Regan had indicated at some earlier time he wanted to return to private business. In\tthe\tMonday night interview, however, Reagan said he quietly hoped to be able use a letter of resignation which Regan had submitted months earlier when the chief of staff indicated he would not likely serve through Reagan’s entire second term. “There was one of those leaks that seems to be so prevalent in this institution,” the president said. “And it leaked publicly. And I guess he felt insulted.” Regan was infuriated when there were news reports of his resignation in late February 1986, coupled with reports of Baker’s selection. CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw, at one point, asked Reagan about Maureen Reagan’s interview statement that allowing Regan to become chief of staff had been her father’s biggest mistake. “I saw that. Happened to be watching television and saw that,” he replied. Asked if he disagreed with her statement, the president said, “No, I said, ‘That’s my girl.’ ”",
