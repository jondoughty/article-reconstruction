    "article_text": "The Cal Poly gymnastics team tied Division 1 San Jose State for first place in a four-team meet Friday night in the Main Gym. The Lady Mustangs, ranked fourth in Division II, and San Jose scored a 171.25. U.C. Santa Barbara scored a 170.45 for second place and Southern Utah State had 161.0. “This is the best score we have had all year,” said Cal Poly head coach Tim Rivera. Kim Wells, the top-ranked gymnast in the Western Region, won the all-around with 35.75 points. She tied Kriss Miller of San Jose for first place on the balance beam with a 9.05. Wells tied for second in the floor exercise (9.05) and the vault (9.0). She also placed third in the uneven bars with an 8.65. Mimi Phene, ranked 20th nationally, was fourth in the overall with 35.35. points. She won the vault with a 9.4, good for a new school record. She also tied for first in the uneven bars with a score of 8.9. Phene did not place on the balance beam or the floor exercise. The crowd was disappointed when Phene successfully completed a double back flip in her floor routine and only received an 8.5. Chris Kotzbach of Santa Barbara placed second in the all-around with 35.65 points, followed by Miller with 35.4. Kotzbach won the floor exercise with a 9.25 and Miller tied for first on the uneven bars and balance beam. Kimm Zernik, a Cal Poly sophomore, injured her knee in the beginning of her floor exercise and was unable to complete the routine. Zernik is one of several Lady Mustangs to be injured this year. Wendy Meyer said when a teammate was injured in the past, the Lady Mustangs had a tendency to give up. But they have learned how unproductive that can be. “We’re not giving up anymore, no matter what happens,” she said. The Lady Mustangs will travel north Friday to compete at San Jose State on Friday. They will then compete in the Chico State Jamboree Invitational on Saturday.",
