    "article_text": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) \u2014 George Bush and Michael Dukakis clashed over deficits, drugs and the Pledge of Allegiance in a crackling campaign debate Sunday night. Bush said, \u201cI hope people don\u2019t think I\u2019m questioning his patriotism,\u2019\u2019 but Dukakis retorted that he was and added, \u201cI resent it.\u2019\u2019 Bush sought repeatedly in the 90-minute debate to depict Dukakis as a liberal Democrat who is \u201cout there out of the mainstream.\u2019\u2019 Dukakis challenged the vice president\u2019s judgment and ticked off a string of what he called Reagan administration failures, with emphasis on the Iran-Contra affair. He said it was a \u201ctragedy\u201d for the president to sell arms to Iran in exchange for hostages, and said Bush endorsed it. The vice president replied, \u201cYes, we shouldn\u2019t trade arms for hostages, but we have made vast improvements in our antiterrorism.\u2019\u2019 Some hostages were freed during the arms dealing with Iran, but others were seized and nine Americans remain in captivity. A question about Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle brought another lively exchange. Bush defended his youthful running mate, said he had been subjected to unfair speculation and added, \u201che has my confidence.\u2019\u2019 Dukakis guessed that \u201cfor most people the notion of President Quayle is a very, very troubling notion.\u2019\u2019 The vice president and the Massachusetts governor shook hands at center stage before the debate and again after. \u201cGood job,\u2019\u2019 Dukakis said to his Republican rival after their 90-minute clash. Both men then headed for post-debate rallies. \u201cI enjoyed it. I thought it was a good night,\u201d said Dukakis. Asked if he won, he replied, \u201cPeople seemed to be pretty enthusiastic.\u201d Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III said, \u201cThe vice president did an extraordinarily good job in our opinion.\u201d He said he thought Bush \u201creinforced the differences we\u2019ve been talking about.\u201d The combatants argued their case a little more than six weeks before Election Day from behind wooden lecterns on a stage at Wait Chapel on Wake Forest University\u2019s campus. The live audience at Wait Chapel on the Wake Forest University\u2019s campus numbered a few thousand \u2014 but the television audience was in the millions. And with many voters still undecided, the campaigns treated the debate as a pivotal event. Neither man committed an obvious gaffe during the 90 minutes. An Associated Press panel of six veteran debate judges gave Dukakis a narrow edge over Bush. Three judges thought Dukakis won and three picked Bush, but the Democrat got the most points overall. Dukakis got top marks for presentation and organization, while Bush bested his opponent in refutation and reasoning. An ABC News poll of 639 debate-watchers taken immediately after the debate found that 44 percent rated Dukakis the winner, 36 percent gave the edge to Bush and 20 percent said it was a tie. The formal debate rules were designed to prohibit direct can-didate-to-candidate comment, but there was no shortage of hostilities. Dukakis was asked to specify three programs he would cut to curb the federal budget, and said he would reduce \u2019\u2019certain weapons systems, which we don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford.\u201d With that, he focused on Bush, and said the Republican wants to spend more on defense, cut capital gains taxes, spend more money on other programs yet impose no new taxes. \u201cIf he\u2019s serious about what he\u2019s saying the only way he can do it is by raiding the Social Security trust fund,\u201d Dukakis said. \u201cIf he keeps this up, he\u2019s going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics,\u201d he said, drawing laughter from the audience with his reference to the television advertising character who exaggerates everything he says about the cars he\u2019s selling. \u201cIs this the time to unleash our one liners?\u201d Bush said in response. \u201cThat answer was about as clear as Boston Harbor,\u201d he said in reference to environmental problems in Dukakis\u2019 home state.
