    "article_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court, which last year said police do not need court warrants to search from airplanes for marijuana growing in fenced-in residential yards, Monday let stand California court decisions limiting the 1986 ruling. The justices, over two dissenting votes, turned down an appeal by California prosecutors aimed at striking down the state court decisions. The decision effectively limits aerial searches for marijuana to navigable public airspace, which begins at 1000 feet, and prevents intrusion into private airspace below that without a search warrant.",
