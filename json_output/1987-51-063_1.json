    "article_text": "The speakers at Friday’s Educational Peace Forum, a retired admiral and a Stanford professor, proved that one does not have to be a flower child to advocate peace. Adm. Noel Gayler, former U.S. Navy commander-in-chief, discussed the use of nuclear weapons by the military. Dr. David Holloway of Stanford University discussed Soviet national security. . Gayler, who spent 45 years-in military service, has become a spokesman for the banning of nuclear weapons. A former nuclear target planner, Gayler was asked when he realized that nuclear weapons should be banned. He replied, “I think when I became aware that there was no rationale to the targeting — that we had a targeting policy which said essentially, ‘We’ve got so many nuclear weapons. Find a target for them.’ ” Gayler said the U.S. should enter into a general nuclear agreement with the Soviet Union,to be followed by other countries. There are many illusions people have about nuclear war, Gayler said. He believes these delusions could be eradicated through education and enlightenment. Gayler listed several delusions, including a delusion about the number of weapons in the world. Balance is not the important thing, he said, because the first 100 nuclear weapons would end the world. Also, Gayler noted, it does not matter where weapons are based — it is where they land See PEACE, back page that counts. He called Star Wars a “magic shield” and a “cruel hoax,” and stated the biggest delusion is that strength is found in nuclear weapons. The Soviets can be contained, said Gayler, but they cannot be coerced. To contain them, he suggested realizing, “There is no sensible military use for nuclear weapons.” Gayler said he has devised a process to help bring peace. This process includes:\treducing threatening language, giving up military and nuclear war fighting doctrines, encouraging exchange, putting a moratorium on further testing and deployment and, most importantly, deep and continuous cuts in nuclear weapons. Gayler listed things the public can do to end the threat of nuclear war, rather than leaving the job up to experts. He suggested that people learn to spread the word about the danger of nuclear war. He asked that the mass media not “bury the problem under yesterday’s ball game.” He advised doctors to say to their patients, “You’re more likely to die from a nuclear war than any other single cause.” David Holloway, an authority on Soviet policy and arms control,- explained Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s new political thinking. He said detente 'needs to be understood to grasp the new thinking. Detente centers around parity, which is equality in numbers and mutual deterrence. Holloway said the process of detente totally collapsed with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Holloway went on to explain Gorbachev’s new thinking, which is based on the premise that victory is impossible with nuclear war. Holloway said that if given the choice, the Soviets would pick peace over socialism. Gorbachev has realized that security has to be mutual. Human race interests will come before proletariat issues, and the world needs cooperation as it becomes interdependent and pluralistic, he said. However, Holloway said he has seen an element of propoganda in Gorbachev’s new thinking. The Educational Peace Forum was co-sponsored by Cal Poly’s Students for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Social Responsibility.",
