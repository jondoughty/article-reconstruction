    "article_text": "His students at Northern Iowa State University knew him as Pawoko, a Native American name given to a captive Condor chick. “Pawoko is a Chumash word that means first to leave the nest,” Pawoko said. “It’s a power word that I adopted for my students to use when they needed a little extra energy.” At Cal Poly, Pawoko is better known as Bob Gish, the university’s new director of the ethnic studies program. Gish, who is of Native American heritage, left, his position at Northern Iowa after 25 years to come to San Luis Obispo. “I was attracted to Cal Poly because I love the American West,” Gish said. “And how much further west can you go than California?” Tlie first thing Gish would like to do here is bring about educational equity. “The American experience is a bunch of diverse experiences mingled together,” Gish said. “The stress of this program will be on the ethnic American culture. A community through diversity is the most desirable outcome.” Gish’s plans for changes in the Cal Poly curriculum include a general education requirement in ethnic studies. Tb do this, Gish will be working closely with the General Education and Breadth Committee, co-chaired by political science professor John Culver. “As of now we have not reached any final decisions,” Culver said. “Bob Gish, the GE&B Committee and a subcommittee for general education will work together to implement the courses.” Culver said he expects the ball to begin rolling for the ethnic studies program by the end of the quarter. The program will focus on four different American cultural experiences, including African-American, Native American, Mexican-American and Asian-American. Gish said the fact that Cal Poly is the last school in the CSU system to implement an ethnic studies program should not be looked upon negatively. “Although Cal Poly has not moved as far as it should, at least it is moving forward now,” Gish said. “It’s important to accentuate the positive and move in that direction.” Along those lines, the next step, Gish said, will be to begin a program leading to a minor in ethnic studies and eventually work toward implementing a major. Gish also plans to create an Ethnic Studies Committee that will communicate between faculty, students and the administration. The problem with the ethnic studies program now is that it is not visible to most of Cal Poly’s students and faculty, Gish said. “We need to mainstream the program as much as possible,” he said. “It is not a visibly packaged program. We need to give it some coherence, higher visibility, direction and focus.” Another goal Gish has is to represent different cultures in all disciplines at Cal Poly. “Cultural studies can be im- plemented into many different disciplines,” Gish said. “Architecture, agriculture and even science have different perspectives from each culture. Our idea is to develop courses for these disciplines as well.” To do this, Gish will need the support from the present faculty at Poly. Gish said he hopes that all faculty can contribute to increasing awareness about the influence of ethnicity in everyday life, “I’d like to see more integration not only in student activities, but in courses as well,” Gish said. “Minorities are not the only people we want to reach. It’s important for everyone to be exposed to different cultures.”",
