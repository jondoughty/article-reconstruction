    "article_text": "His students at Northern Iowa State University knew him as Pawoko, a Native American name given to a captive Condor chick. “Pawoko is a Chumash word that means first to leave the nest,” Pawoko said. “It’s a power word that I adopted for my students to use when they needed a little extra energy.” At Cal Poly, Pawoko is better known as Bob Gish, the university’s new director of the ethnic studies program. Gish, who is of Native American heritage, left, his position at Northern Iowa after 25 years to come to San Luis Obispo. “I was attracted to Cal Poly because I love the American West,” Gish said. “And how much further west can you go than California?” Tlie first thing Gish would like to do here is bring about educational equity. “The American experience is a bunch of diverse experiences mingled together,” Gish said. “The stress of this program will be on the ethnic American culture. A community through diversity is the most desirable outcome.” Gish’s plans for changes in the Cal Poly curriculum include a general education requirement in ethnic studies. Tb do this, Gish will be working closely with the General Education and Breadth Committee, co-chaired by political science professor John Culver. “As of now we have not reached any final decisions,” Culver said. “Bob Gish, the GE&B Committee and a subcommittee for general education will work together to implement the courses.” Culver said he expects the ball to begin rolling for the ethnic studies program by the end of the quarter. The program will focus on four different American cultural experiences, including African-American, Native American, Mexican-American and Asian-American. “Although Cal Poly has not moved as far as it should, at least it is moving forward now.”",
