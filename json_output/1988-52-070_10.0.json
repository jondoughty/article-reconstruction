    "article_text": "With only seven players able to play Saturday night against U.C. Riverside, the Cal Poly basketball team knew from the start that too many fouls could destroy all hopes of victory. The Lady Mustangs’ roster dropped to seven last week after junior center Stacy Rooney was declared academically ineligible. Yet with almost three minutes remaining in the game and Cal Poly ahead, 65-64, four out of the five Lady Mustangs on the floor had four fouls. And sophomore Russia Madden, who fouled out, was watching helplessly from the bench. “I told them, ‘Keep your defense aggressive, but be smart,’ ” said head coach Jill Or-rock. The advice paid off, as Cal Poly held on to win, 73-66. With 2:46 left, sophomore guard Jody Hasselfield drew a foul and sank two free throws to stretch Cal Poly’s lead to 67-64. But the Highlanders responded with a field goal. “That is everything,” said Or-rock. “It’s what we’ve been working on.” Although Cal Poly appeared to be the aggressors, the Highlanders threatened to take the lead several times in the first half. However, their efforts were only marginally successful. Riverside shot often, but couldn’t sink the shots. As a result. Cal Poly ended the half ahead, 39-31. The second half witnessed a mild comeback by the Highlanders, but more missed shots and a rash of steals by the Lady Mustangs confirmed the win. Cal Poly accumulated 10 steals to Riverside’s three. The win raised the Lady Mustangs’ record to 4-2 in the California Collegiate Athletic Association and 10-9 overall. Their next game is Thursday at Cal State Dominguez Hills. Game time is 5:45 p.m. DARRELL MIHO/Mustang Dally",
