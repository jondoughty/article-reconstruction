With alarming statistics and fiery words, Boyes praised privatization and criticized the growth of governmental regulations and controls in America. “What we are doing doesn’t make any sense,” Boyes said emphatically to the Five Cities-Pismo Beach Branch of the American Association of University Women. “We need to break the strangle hold of governmental control.” Specifically, Boyes singled out the governmental regulations on small businesses in California. “Californians, there is a potential for losing what you have!” Boyes said. Although California could be called the eighth-largest country in the world, this state is losing many small businesses each year. “In California there is an antientrepreneur, anti-newcomer attitude with its ‘welcome stranger’ taxes, water rationing,” Boyes said. The vast number of permits and regulations required for small businesses are making it impossible to make a living in California, he said. Thrning to the regulations and controls exercised by the government nationwide, Boyes pushed for more privatization. “Privatization doesn’t mean we get rid of it,” he said. “It just becomes more efficient.” He believes privatization of the Department of Motor Vehicles, garbage collection, building inspectors, prisons, roads and education would increase efficiency and reduce expenses. When questioned about the possibilities of toll roads, Boyes said, “Okay, we would pay tolls, but we are paying for something we are using.” SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The two Koreas exchanged signed texts Tuesday of a historic agreement intended to keep nuclear arms out of their region and requiring the Communist North to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program.
