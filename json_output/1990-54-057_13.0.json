    "article_text": "Cal Poly’s Plant Operations was honored Friday with a “Thank You” party for building new offices for the Public Safety Department. “They did such a good job we just decided that we would thank them,” said Richard C. Brug, director of Public Safety. These new administrative offices, adjacent to the firc/police station, will house the director of Public Safety, a conference room, a lab and clerical offices. The existing police station is scheduled to be remodeled, leaving more room for the police and parking officals. Dispatch has been moved to the back of the old building, enabling the front olTice to be dedicated entirely to parking and non-emergency business. The new offices give Public Safety more room for equipment and personnel. It also enables staff members to have their own offices, thus avoiding the unproductive overcrowding that has been prevalent. The front counter is entirely staffed by students and will be open Mondays through Fridays Sec NF.W OFFICES, page 8 from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. All work on the new offices and the police station was done by Plant Operations. “This is all in-house work,” said Brug of the remodeled warehouse. Plant Operations ' provides maintenance and does small construction for the campus. The job was to remodel an existing warehouse. Drafting Technician Rex Wolf, a 1978 Cal Poly architecture graduate, was put in charge of developing the plans for the project. “Normally something like this you would see done by contractor,” said Wolf. The warehouse was vacated by Foundation, which moved to a new building near the poultry unit. The project took about four months to complete and cost Public Safety $40,000. The rest of the building still exists as a warehouse and is being used by the housing department for storage. There wasn’t “a whole lot to start with,” said Plant Operations carpenter Leonard Hall. Hall and co-workers Clancy Armstrong and Pat Griffen did most of the “master work,” said Brug. All the plumbers, carpenters, electricians and others from Plant Operations did all of the work, making this one of the campus’s biggest projects. The landscaping around the building was done by Cal Poly groundskeepers. There are plans to install rest rooms and more mezzanine space for storage in the old warehouse.",
