    "article_text": "climate, consisting of warm, dry days and cool nights, allows a proper balance between sugar and acid levels to develop. “Acidity stays higher in this climate,’’ said Fountain. “It wouldn’t hold under a hot climate.’’ Clay Thompson, winemaker for both Chamisal Vineyards and for his own brand, Claiborne and Churchill, said that a lot of the climate characteristics can be attributed to the ocean breezes. “It’s the cool ocean air that comes down from Morro Bay and blows right down across the Los Osos V alley into the Edna Valley,’* he said. “It makes a long, cool growing season, which is good for the Chardonnay.’’ Just on the other side of Cuesta Ridge and in the San Joaquin Valley, said Thompson, the climate is too hot in the summer for the types of grapes grown in Central Coast regions. Victor Roberts, winemaker for Crestón Manor Vineyards and Winery, said the soil also plays an important role. “What we’re looking for is clay and sandy loam, a lack of underlying hard-pan, and land that accepts water well,’’ he said. “You have to have soil that resists compaction.’’ Roberts said the owners of Crestón Manor spent almost two years looking throughout California for good vineyard land. The combination of climate and soil conditions on the Central Coast is what they were looking for to create a good balance of sugar and acid leveb in the grapes.",
