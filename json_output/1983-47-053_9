So the Mustangs concentrated their collective efforts in upsetting UC-Uverside Friday evening in the CCAA opener for both teams. The Highlanders entered the contest ranked No. 8 in the nation in Division II. The girls talked all week about beating- Riverside. They knew they had a chance; and weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just kidding themselves into believing they had a chance. But, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to be. The Highlanders, who led 40-34 at intermission, held off every Mustang second-half charge en route to a 77-69 win. Saturday night at Pomona, Poly went 0-2 in the CCAA standings as the Broncos whipped the visitors^ 93-47.",
