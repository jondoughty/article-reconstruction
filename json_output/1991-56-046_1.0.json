    "article_text": "‘Tis the Christmas season, and nothinfi tops the holiday more than the scent of a fresh-cut Christmas tree. For the third year in a row, students can do their Christmas tree shopping on campus. The natural resource management department’s enterprise project has about 550 Monterey pine trees and some pre-cut red fir trees to ch(X)se from. The tree faiTn was planted in 1984 and opened for business four years lattm with a stock of 220 trees. Last year, tree sales topped the 300 mark, and this year the department is hoping for more, said Mike DeLasaux, a NRM instructional technician. DeLasaux said enterprise projects are available through the Sch(X)l of Agi'iculture. The program, which is open to anyone, enables students to develop projects and experiments. He said the students must provide a proposal that outlines the project and its expenses and shows a complete budget statement. If it is approved, the Cal Poly Foundation supplies the start-up money. DeLasaux said the tree farm is a unique enterprise project because it’s managed by the Cal Poly Logging Sports Team. It is one of the few projects that a club team manages. He said the projects are usually developed and run by a few students who split the profits. Craig Linguist, a natural resource management senior and member of the logging club team, said the club needs about 812,000 to host the American Western Forestry Conclave in April. This is a major logging event which will bring forestry schools such as Humboldt State and Oregon State to Cal Poly to compete in logging competitions. Last year, Poly placed second in the AWFC in Colorado. Linguist, who also managed the tree farm for three yeaj’s, said “Rarely do we make a profit.” He said some of the money is used to pay back the debt to the Foundation. DeLasaux said each quarter three students sign up for this project. They work on the tree farm doing maintenance duties. He said the students are in demand throughout the summer growing season when they must shape the trees four or five times, as needed. Currently, only four acres of Poly agricultural land are planted with Christmas trees, although DeLasaux said four others are available. “At the moment, the thought is that we don’t want to plant more trees because we don’t want to appear too commercial and compete with local growers,” he said. “First and foremost, the project is supposed to be an educational experience.” Curtis Edson, the tree farm manager and a natural resources senior, said, “A lot more is involved than people think. It doesn’t just entail selling the trees. It takes a lot of time and effort to maintain (the trees).” DeLasaux said the students involved learn everything there is to know about growing the trees, particularly overall maintenance and how to manage this type of project. In February, Edson said the stumps left from the cut trees wtII be removed, the land tilled and seedlings planted to continue the growing cycle. The farni is located on Sten-ner Creek Road, just off Highway 1. For more information call 756-2702.",
