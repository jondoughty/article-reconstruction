    "article_text": "'I'he iron fist of President Warren J. Baker strikes again. This time he is using it on students. It seems if Baker doesn’t like the way someone does something — no matter who it is — big changes are soon to follow. Now it’s one of the duties the ASl president — the person elected to represent students — that Baker has decided to cut into. It has been a tradition that the ASI president speak at graduation — it was one of the rights that went along with the job. But Baker apparently didn’t like the speech of Jeff Sanders, last year’s ASI president. So Baker decided an ASI president would not speak at graduation again. He made his decision without talking to the students. (He says it was recommended by the Commencement Committee, but no record of that exists.) Last summer Baker sent a memo to current ASI president Kevin Creighton stating the right of the ASI president to speak at graduation would be taken away. Instead, a student would be chosen based on a academic criteria he outlined in the memo. Who is graduation for: students and parents or Baker and friends? Baker didn’t need the ASI President to “resign” his elected right, since it was only a Cal Poly tradition. It was just taken away. Yes, graduation does expose the university to the community, but that doesn’t take away that graduation is mainly for students. If Baker wants a graduating student with a good academic record to speak, add one to the program. Yes, graduation is long, but a much higher percentage of the ceremony is taken up by non-students speaking than students. The representatives from various school councils have suggested the ASI president speak if that person is graduating. The Mustang Daily Editorial Board suggests that the Student Senate respond the same way. The ASI president should be allowed to speak; it is one thing students elect him to do. If Baker wants to add one of the academic winners from one of the seven schools, there is always room for another student speaker. President Baker, talk to students about changes. Commencement, after all, is for us, not you. We want the ASI president to speak at graduation.",
