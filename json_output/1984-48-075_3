    "article_text": "   The Student Senate tonight is voting on a Pasco Package which would send a message to the California Legislature that Cal Poly students support the Legislature\u2019s peace resolution.    If the Student Senate passes the Peace Package said Julie Clayton, author of the resolution and senator from Human Development and Education, it would send e letter to Sen Lula Obispo\u2019s representatives that 16,000 students support the Legislature\u2019s resolution.    The Legislature\u2019s resolution, if passed, would tend s message to the United States Senate urging them to call for the immediate halt to the deployment of nuclear weapons.    The resolution also calls for a letter to be sent to Congress and the President of the United States urging them to increase peace making efforts and dialogue in order to decrease United States/Soviet Union tension. ( One reason for her resolution was to increase the knowledge of Student Senators, she said. \u201cMy underlying purpose is to increase the awareness of the Student Senate, councils and dubs.\u2019\u2019    When a resolution or bill is introduced she said, the senate, the student councils and dubs must study the proposal and this increases their awareness of the social issues.    Many senators have been critical of resolutions which do not directly relate to education, calling for the senate to address issues which only affect students\u2019 education.    \u201cI don\u2019t think my resolution will pass,\u201d said Clayton. \u201cBecause there is a lot of confusion among Student Senators as to their roles as senators and citizens of the United States.\u2019\u2019    Clayton said that she will continue to introduce tjills and resolutions which are of great importance to Cel Poly students as citizens of the United States.    \u201cI\u2019m not pushing my political viewpoints on anyone,\u2019\u2019 Please era page 9          she said. But as elected student leaders she said, we should take stands on issues which affect everyone.    The senate is also scheduled to vote on s resolution which recommends that students entering University of California or State Universities be allowed to fulfill e foreign language requirement in high school or through a proficiency test if a student hasn't taken a foreign language in high school.    The Academic Senate recently passed a similar bill, said Senator Kevin Creighton, author of the resolution. A state-wide entrance requirement which can be fulfilled by students in high school is a better way to deal with the requirement, he added.    The Student Senate meeting starts tonight at 7 p.m. in UU 220 and all students are invited to attend and address the senate.",
