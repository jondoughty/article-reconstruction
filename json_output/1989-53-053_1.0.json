    "article_text": "The dream of freedom for blacks in America is not something that died when Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in Memphis 20 years ago. The dreamer may be dead, but the dream is alive and well in the continued struggle for a nonracist America, a Cal State Sacramento professor said. David Covin, professor of government and ethnic studies at Sacramento, spoke in the Cal Poly Distinguished Afro-American Lecture Series Thursday to a crowd of about 65. Covin painted a disturbing picture of 1963 America. Imagine being assaulted knowing that whoever assaulted you would not be punished. Imagine having to pay full fare for a bus trip but not being able to sit down. Imagine being restricted or barred from using public facilities. Imagine not being able to vote. Blacks in this country (especially in the South) have not had to imagine the above racist policies, they’ve lived under them for a large part of this nation’s 200 years. Covin said. In short, they were excluded from the constitutional guarantees of the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. “If you can be beaten, raped or even killed without legal redress —\tas black people routinely were —\tthen you do not have citizenship rights,’’ Covin said. “In the South, there would be signs at public restrooms — ladies, gentlemen and colored. Jim Crow was the law of the land,” Covin said, referring to the term used to describe discrimination against Negroes. “Bigots ruled in pulpits all across the country,” Covin said. “Racial violence was the order of the day; racial attacks on college campuses:\ta conservative ad- ministration occupied the White House:\tindividualism reigned supreme and Americans were obsessed with their material well-being — just like today.” Covin focused his presentation on the movement and the man, choosing to make King’s birthday a cause for progress and not just remembrance. “Nobody was prepared to say in public that this was a racist, oppressive, exploitive society,” Covin said. “King did that: he established the moral agenda of his day. “It is important to reflect on these conditions because members of my race are free in a way that black people were not free in 1963, and that Martin Luther King, Jr. was not free as long as he lived.” On a balcony in Memphis, Tenn., April 4, 1968, a shot fired from a hidden sniper stole the life of 39-year-old King, the clergyman and civil rights leader who was instrumental in making America look at the way it treated blacks. There was no time for goodbyes to the millions of blacks and whites across America who had focused their hopes on King as the spokesman for human dignity. The dreamer was murdered but the dream could not be — the dream lives on in people like Covin who was invited to Cal Poly as part of the Distinguished Afro-American Lecture Series. ‘‘We are likely to forget that Martin Luther King’s active political life spanned about 13 years,” Covin said. ‘‘He was a youth in comparison to me.”",
