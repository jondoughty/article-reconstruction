    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES — The U.S. Forest Service has laid off hundreds of seasonal firefighters at the height of Southern California's fire season, leaving some officials worried about the agency’s ability to battle forest blazes. More than 130 temporary firefighters, who typically are hired to beef up crews from May to November, were laid off this week in the Angeles National Forest, as the start of the fiscal year forced forest officials to plan for an expected $2 million budget cut, officials said. In the San Bernardino National Forest, about 120 temporary firefighters were laid off, and similar layoffs were reported in the Los Padres and Cleveland National Forests. The layoffs will mean that engine companies will respond to fires with three-person rather than five-person crews and fire stations will no longer operate seven days a week but will cover the forests on an overlapping five-day-a-week schedule. In ad-' dition, U.S. Forest Service firefighters will rely more heavily on help from municipal and county fire departments. Forest officials said the layoffs are risky. The key in wild-land forest management, as we say, is Tlit 'em hard and keep 'em small,’” said Angeles Forest fire management officer Tom Harbour. *If you hit a fire hard at the beginning, it won’t become a danger to anyone but the firefighters. It’s when a fire escapes that it causes problems.... And as far as what’s going to happen vdth fires escaping, well, that’s going to be a crapshoot now.” Forest Service officials in Washington blamed a lack of planning at the national forest level for the sudden personnel cuts. Southern California forests have some of the biggest budgets in the Forest Service, said Harry Croft, assistant director for planning in the service's fire and aviation department. But a substantial amount of their funding year after year has been lost to high overhead costs, such as support staff and high rents, he said. Washington has warned Southern California officials to curb their overhead costs, \"but a lot of the line officers have either been in denial or reluctant to look at the issue,” Croft said. Harbour and others dispute this claim, saying the real problem stems from budget tightening at the federal level, increases in the cost of leasing firefighting equipment, changes in the way federal money has been spread among California’s national forests by the Forest Service’s regional office in San Francisco and a change in the rules regarding use of a special emergency fire fund.",
