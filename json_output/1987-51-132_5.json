    "article_text": "No, it’s within a reasonable lifespan of people still emotionally troubled by what happened. It was such an epic disaster that it will be imprinted in their minds for a long time. The times they are a-changin’. In 1982 I left a good job at Marineland to come to Cal Poly. At the time KMET was my favorite radio station, we used punch cards in computer classes and Mustang Daily was put together on manual typewriters. All that’s changed. Marineland and KMET are gone, while the journalism and computer science departments have entered the 20th century. For better or worse, change is inevitable, except when the invisible hand of bureaucracy gets a grip on an idea and holds onto it long after it has outlived its usefulness. The General Education and Breadth requirements, that bouillabaisse of classes that dominates our college experience, is one idea that has gone awry, destroying students’ enthusiasm and replacing it with boredom. There is an old saying that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. But when the subject is philospophy, psychology or the life sciences, a little knowledge is a useless thing.",
