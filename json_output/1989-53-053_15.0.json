    "article_text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Investigators hope photographs taken by low-flying military airplanes will turn up clues in the cases of two missing girls, including 9-year-old Michaela Garecht of Hayward, FBI officials said Tuesday. The sophisticated aerial search, to be conducted Wednesday if weather permits, is one of two advanced and relatively new techniques the FBI will utilize in the searches, according to Richard Held, special agent in charge of te San Francisco office. Held also released a computer-enhanced photograph of what experts say kidnap victim Kevin Collins may look like today. Collins disappeared from San Francisco on Feb. 10, 1984 at the age of ten. On the eve of Kevin’s 15th birthday Jan. 24, Held said the new image helps investigators “have some idea of the Kevin Collins that we’re looking for today as opposed to the Kevin Collins we were looking for in 1983.’’ To make the photograph, which is based on the best available picture of the boy, exF>erts looked at how the aging process has changed the appearance of Kevin’s two older brothers, particularly 16-year-old Gary, Held said. The photo is part of a flyer which will be released to FBI offices and law enforcement agencies nationwide and will hopefully help generate renewed public interest. Held said. “We need public assistance to locate these children,’’ he said. Seven-year-old Amber Swartz-Garcia of Pinole vanished June 3 just minutes after she went outside to jump rope. Michaela was kidnapped Nov. 19 outside a neighborhood grocery store near her home in Hayward. Witnesses, including an 8-year-old playmate of Michaela’s, said the abductor was a white man in his early 20s, about 6 feet tall with shoulder-length, blond hair and a pockmarked or pimpled face. The fourth-grader’s disappearance has generated unprecedented community response and a massive volunteer effort. The reward for her safe recently reached $178,000.",
