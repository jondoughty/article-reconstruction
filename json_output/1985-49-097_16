' < \u201cWe haven\u2019t won anything yet. We need 12 more wins to get it,\u201d said Oilers winger-Glenn Anderson, whose overtime goal Saturday night lifted Edmoi^on to a 4-3 victory and a tnree-game sweep of the Los Angeles Kings. The narrow victory was not unlike, the Oilers\u2019 first two victories in the series in Edmonton. They edged the Kings 3-2 in overtime in the first game and 4-2 on an empty-net goal in the second. \u201cThis jvas a close series, and _ all three games could have gone either way,\u201d said Edmonton Coach Glen Sather. Sather said the Oilers could not have won without the deft goaltending they got from Grant Fuhr. ' The difference was the play of Fuhr and our playoff experience,\u201d said Sather. Wayhe Gretzky, who did not score a goal in the series, said. \u201cGoaltending is the playoffs. It's been that way for 50 years. \"   * The Oilers are expecting the rest of the playoffs to be just like this hard-fought series. \u201cIt seems that everytime you get past a smaller mountain, there's a bigger mountain waiting around the corner,\u201d said Anderson. If nothing else, the Kings, who played well against the Oilers in the regular season, once again proved themselves a stern test for the defending champs. \u201cWe have to optimistic about next year,\u201c said Los Angeles wing Dave Taylor. \u201cWe made some great strides.\u201d",
