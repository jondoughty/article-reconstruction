    "article_text": "The versatility a speech communication degree offers in adapting to any job situation was a main point stressed at a career information symposium Saturday. Presented by the Cal Poly speech department and an internship project of Word of Mouth President Christine Fagerlin, the symposium featured former Cal Poly speech communication graduates who have entered various career fields. “Most U.S. industry is becoming more service and marketing orientated,” said Bob Perry, a 1971 graduate and bank manager. “A speech communication degree helps prepare graduates to adapt to the conditions of this need for marketing.” Valerie Gilbert, a 1985 gradu-ate and sales manager of a Bay Area hotel, stressed the importance of persuasive skills gained with a speech major. “Communication is the most essential skill needed because it allows a general awareness of how people and organizations work,” Gilbert said. For Fagerlin, the symposium culminated months of organizing and provided the opportunity for speech communication colleagues to come together. “Networking and utilizing resources by making and keeping contacts was a valuable part of the symposium,” Fagerlin said. She added that the symposium was a good opportunity to show speech communication majors career prospects. “Many people have knowledge, but can’t tell others about it,” she said. “This major allows the ability to communicate and express knowledge inall walks of life.”",
