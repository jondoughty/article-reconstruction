Many students, though, know very little about what is going on, and raly on ths Daily to inform thsm. Unfortunately, I find that tha Daily covers moet events only after they have occurred, and then provides a tiiort and shaBow account of arhat hap-panad with no background or inaids information on tha event itself. I thought that the sariae of artidas on Poly Royal and last year\u2019s coverage of Greek Week was not thorough enough to say the least, and there was no coverage of the Paao Robles air shoie with the \u201cBlue Angds\u201d. One of the Angela happened to ba a Cal Poly alumnus who could have been interviewed. I wish that the Daily could be more proactive in reporting events rather than reactive. Please report events and activitiss before they happen so that the students may be aware of upcoming events.",
