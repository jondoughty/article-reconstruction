    "article_text": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) — George Bush and Michael Dukakis clashed over deficits, drugs and the Pledge of Allegiance in a crackling campaign debate Sunday night. Bush said, “I hope people don’t think I’m questioning his patriotism,’’ but Dukakis retorted that he was and added, “I resent it.’’ Bush sought repeatedly in the 90-minute debate to depict Dukakis as a liberal Democrat who is “out there out of the mainstream.’’ Dukakis challenged the vice president’s judgment and ticked off a string of what he called Reagan administration failures, with emphasis on the Iran-Contra affair. He said it was a “tragedy” for the president to sell arms to Iran in exchange for hostages, and said Bush endorsed it. The vice president replied, “Yes, we shouldn’t trade arms for hostages, but we have made vast improvements in our antiterrorism.’’ Some hostages were freed during the arms dealing with Iran, but others were seized and nine Americans remain in captivity. A question about Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle brought another lively exchange. Bush defended his youthful running mate, said he had been subjected to unfair speculation and added, “he has my confidence.’’ Dukakis guessed that “for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very, very troubling notion.’’ The vice president and the Massachusetts governor shook hands at center stage before the debate and again after. “Good job,’’ Dukakis said to his Republican rival after their 90-minute clash. Both men then headed for post-debate rallies. “I enjoyed it. I thought it was a good night,” said Dukakis. Asked if he won, he replied, “People seemed to be pretty enthusiastic.” Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III said, “The vice president did an extraordinarily good job in our opinion.” He said he thought Bush “reinforced the differences we’ve been talking about.” The combatants argued their case a little more than six weeks before Election Day from behind wooden lecterns on a stage at Wait Chapel on Wake Forest University’s campus. The live audience at Wait Chapel on the Wake Forest University’s campus numbered a few thousand — but the television audience was in the millions. And with many voters still undecided, the campaigns treated the debate as a pivotal event. Neither man committed an obvious gaffe during the 90 minutes. An Associated Press panel of six veteran debate judges gave Dukakis a narrow edge over Bush. Three judges thought Dukakis won and three picked Bush, but the Democrat got the most points overall. Dukakis got top marks for presentation and organization, while Bush bested his opponent in refutation and reasoning. An ABC News poll of 639 debate-watchers taken immediately after the debate found that 44 percent rated Dukakis the winner, 36 percent gave the edge to Bush and 20 percent said it was a tie. The formal debate rules were designed to prohibit direct can-didate-to-candidate comment, but there was no shortage of hostilities. Dukakis was asked to specify three programs he would cut to curb the federal budget, and said he would reduce ’’certain weapons systems, which we don’t need and can’t afford.” With that, he focused on Bush, and said the Republican wants to spend more on defense, cut capital gains taxes, spend more money on other programs yet impose no new taxes. “If he’s serious about what he’s saying the only way he can do it is by raiding the Social Security trust fund,” Dukakis said. “If he keeps this up, he’s going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics,” he said, drawing laughter from the audience with his reference to the television advertising character who exaggerates everything he says about the cars he’s selling. “Is this the time to unleash our one liners?” Bush said in response. “That answer was about as clear as Boston Harbor,” he said in reference to environmental problems in Dukakis’ home state. Running mates Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen meet in Omaha, Neb., on Oct. S.",
