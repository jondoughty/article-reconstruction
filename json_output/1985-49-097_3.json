Candidate John Carroll, a speech communication major, said that students don't know enough about the Foundation. Carroll. 21, cited studying the Foundation's profit and loss statements as his first priority in regard to the cor pornt inn \"!t '•< ne<'fs>^.iu \\ t” find uu' how. !

Students have little control over Foundation, Dunton said, because there is only one student member on the nine-member board of directors. “One voice in nine isn't a whole lot,\" Dunton said. The student representative, currently business administration major Lori Dematteis, is nominated by the deans of the different schools and then selected by President Warren Baker. Dunton said President Baker said he is w riling to I'tiange this (selec-' !■ I' I'1 IS-\"' lui '■ d It I.\" s ,p , .r :lie St ud* It ■>. . ;H ' I < u In I . '       ■ ■ 'd add.

Dunton, who said he feels there should be more students on the board, added he would like to see the student body have a voice in the allocation of the monies the Foundation takes in. He estimated that two-thirds of these funds are generated from students who patronize the Foundation-run Campus services. \"It's our money,” Dunton said. \"I think we should have some say as to where that money grx's Current Iv Baker makt«. recominerulH11('I'-i a« to Ik'A the ex.e'.'- funds will he -•peiU.

Students make the final decision at the ballot box, Dunton said. “Students voted to pay for their recreation facility \" at San Jose State, he said, and at California State University, Chico \"students have control of the whole operation.” Dunton said he would like the Foundation to be more accountable to students. \"The Foundation does a lot of good things, but that doesn't mean we have to overlook other things or not ask ()uesti\"n«,\" I )unt on said Agricultural business management major Mike Mendes, the third candidate, said he feels there is not enough ASI input in Foundation decisions, and suggested this be remedied by adding more students to the board. “It’s the ASI’s responsibility (to the student body) to monitor the workings of the Foundation,” the 22-year-oId Mendes said. He feels some of the profits accrued by the Foundation should be used to subsidize the cost of items students can only buy from El Corral Bookstore, particularly textbooks. “There is a 21 to 22 percent mark-up (on textbooks),” Mendes said, adding that bookstore operating expenses are 22 to 23 percent. The margin of profit on textbooks ~isn’t great, Mendes said, but lower prices could be achieved by subsidizing them with the sale of the other bookstore items. Mendes cautioned that' lowering prices of some Foundation services outright might mean sacrificing other services, including donation generation and athletics. ‘‘We don’t want to lose services;” Mendes said. ”It’s like paying taxes. If you want those services, you’re going to have to pay for your part...bpt (the ASI) needs to act as a check and balance for the Foundation.",
