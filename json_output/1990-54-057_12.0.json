    "article_text": "After winning eight straight Division II national titles, the Cal Poly head coach for women’s cross country said that his team is one of the top 10 programs in the United States. Lance Harter — who was recently named as an assistant coach to the U.S. women’s track and field team for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona — also led his track team to a national championship last year, and five of the past nine years. Harter said this success could not have been possible without the right recruiting. “I think the reason we’ve had successful recruiting is that we have gone after a certain type of athlete that fits our personality as a coaching staff,” Harter said. “When you have both the athlete and the coach on the same wavelength, and have the same drive to be successful, then most likely the two of them are going to be compatible and work together at achieving the goals for the athlete.” Harter, who believes he is the first Division II coach named to the Olympic team, said that he has always been motivated to do the best job he can. “Being a democratic type of presenter as a coach makes for a lot more work,” Harter said. “It’s a lot easier to be just totally autocratic.” Not only is Harter concerned about the athlete on the track, but off the track as well. “1 think “I was taught ever since I was young to — whatever I do — do a good job,” he said. Harter, who is in his 11th year coaching at Cal Poly, takes a humanistic approach to coaching, which makes it more difficult for him. that is one of *he reasons for our success,” he said. Becoming an assistant coach for the 1992 Olympics has not changed his responsibilities at Cal Poly, or himself. “I’m still the same guy, I just get an extra pair of sweats that say U.S.A. on the back,” he said. Harter’s position as an Olympic coach has already started. He has such responsibilities as paperwork and phone contacts. He will also travel to international competitions in an attempt to establish solid relations between athletes and the 1992 Olympic coaching staff. “So when we go to Spain, we’re one solid identity. They know who we are, we know who they are, and we’re comfortable with each other,” Harter said. After the Olympics, Harter plans to continue coaching at Cal Poly, even though he has had many other offers. “There are very few jobs I’d even consider,” he said. “We (my family and 1) are very content here.” Harter finds Cal Poly to be a beautiful place to recruit, due to the unique blend of academics first and athletics second — a philosophy that is not necessarily practiced in a lot of universities across the United States.",
