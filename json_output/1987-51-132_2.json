    "article_text": "Tipsy Taxi is soliciting funds from clubs and community organizations after receiving $2,000 of the $2,500 requested under the 1987-1988 ASI budget. Coordinator Franklin Burris said the program needed $2,700 from ASI but only asked for $2,500, so is now looking for an additional $700. Poly Phase has already donated $100 to the Tipsy Taxi program. Dave Benham, a member of Poly Phase and also a senator from the School of Engineering, suggested that his club make the donation. Benham said Poly Phase thinks it is important to discourage drunk driving and to improve student/ community relations. Benham said he hopes to make a statement to other clubs that Greek organizations shouldn’t have to carry the burden of community relations. Benham also sees the donation to Tipsy Taxi as a thanks to the patrons of the Poly Phase book exchange. Burris said he wants to get funding from clubs as well as from fraternities and sororities. Walt Lambert, coordinator of Greek Affairs, said, “I try to en-See TAXI, back page to approach,” said Higgins, mentioning companies such as Hewlett-Packard that donate equipment and funds to universities. “There are some gray areas on who we can approach. We haven’t hammered out a formal policy yet.” Higgins added that ASI is picky about whc it gets for the sponsorships. “The company must have a good name,” he said. “The administration was concerned with Coors coming because of the alcohol issue, but it was very well done and they never once pushed drinking beer.” Higgins said that in the future corporate sponsorship will be a great way to bring top-notch speakers and entertainment to Cal Poly. “It can cost us up to $20,000 to put on some shows,” he said. “This way we minimize our risk, make some money and get good quality programs.” Cal Poly’s president has to split his loyalties between campus and outside obligations, but his secretary helps him budget his time.",
