    "article_text": "In an effort to increase ethnic diversity in the College of Agriculture, Cal Poly announced in late April plans for an Equity Leadership Program to attract young minority students to careers in agriculture and natural resources management. The program was initiated in response to a proposal authored by Natural Resources Management Department Head Norman Pillsbury and natural resources management professor Richard Thompson. Their proposal described a need to attract potential leaders from a wider source of ethnic backgrounds. Thompson said national statistics from the U.S. Department of Education show an overall lack of minorities in programs related to agriculture and natural resources management. “Part of it comes from misleading images of what these careers involve,” Thompson said. “I’m convinced that several ethnic groups don’t believe there are ... professions to be had in these fields because they have bad images of them.” The program is the result of a joint partnership between Cal Poly, the Soil Conservation Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service, Together, they will provide the $100,000 needed to co- fund a liaison office and enact the program. The purpose of the program is to get a diverse population interested in agricultural and natural resource careers, according to Associate Dean of Agriculture Wally Mark. “There are a lot of stigmas about careers in agriculture and natural resources,” Mark said. “We have to overcome (them) in order for them to become interested.” Animal Science sophomore Antonio Gutierrez, president of Latinos in Agriculture, said certain stigmas exist in terms of what kind of agriculture-related jobs are available. “I think it’s because a lot of people. See EQUITY, page 5 especially Latinos, think they’re going to go out in the field and work,“ Gutierrez said. “A lot of their parents think they’d be better off as engineers. “Some parents don’t understand that you can get the same kind of jobs as an ag major.” Gutierrez added his club actively recruits high school students and encourages them to think about careers in agriculture. “I feel that the more you expose it to minorities, the more you will get,” Gutierrez said. According to a report published by the Institutional Studies Office in winter quarter, minorities make up 16 percent of the Natural Resources Management Department. In the College of Agriculture, 17 percent are minority students. Thompson said ethnic minorities statistically pursue an education in business, engineering or liberal arts. Many minority students, he said, do not realize the career opportunities in environmental and forestry consulting, such as with the U.S. Forest Service or the National Park Service. Pillsbury said part of the problem is these careers are not typically viewed as science-based professions. “These are professions that require a solid science base, mathematical and statistical expertise and good public skills,” Pillsbury said. “People need to see role models working in these kinds of fields in a way that is realistic.” But Pillsbury said the program is not only for minorities. “It would be impossible to build leaders in an environment that is not representative of the real workplace where all ethnic groups are present,” he said. Pillsbury plans to use the 3,800-acre Swanton Pacific Ranch in Santa Cruz County as an integral part of the program. Cal Poly acquired the ranch from alumnus A1 Smith, who willed it to the school upon his death early in winter quarter. Pillsbury said the progi’am would use existing facilities. The students, he added, also would be able to use the land’s resources. In addition, he said the department is seeking funding to build new facilities. Pillsbury said the students also will visit Bureau of Land Management sites, soil conservation field stations and many forests and parks. But details still need to be worked out, according to Pillsbury and Thompson. Thompson said the program would probably create environmental camps for students in elementary school where they would learn how to take water quality measurements and how to identify various animal species. Older students would probably participate in internships, Thompson said. Regardless of exactly how the program will be designed, both Pillsbury and Thompson agree it will teach students about careers in agriculture and natural resources. “There is none quite like this program,” Pillsbury said. “There are a number of programs that are nature camps, but this one is focused on careers. Right from the very beginning, they are going to see that they can be this professional person out there helping to make decisions.”",
