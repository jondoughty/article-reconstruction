    "article_text": "In an effort to control the increasing number of backpack thefts at El Corral Bookstore, a video camera has been installed to monitor the backpack locker area at the front of the store. Public Safety Investigator Ray Barrett hopa the video camera, which was installed by the Cal Poly Public Safety Pepartment about two-weeks ago uid ctm-dnuaUy monitors the backpack storage area, will aid the department in catching backpack thieves. Aooordiiig to Berrett, the video camera has been very successful in awisting the department in its efforts to control such thefts. In a four-day period between March 28 and 31, four backpacks were reported stolen from the bookstore and an additional one was reported taken from the Snack Bar. But according to Berrett, many more backpacks are stolen from these areas on campus, yet students often will report sudi incidents only to the bookstore and not inform the Public Safety Department. To reduce the chance of having their backpacks stolen, Berrett suggests students check their packs into the check-in booth in front of the bookstore during the first week of the new quarter or put them into the coin-operated lockers. Berren reminds studenu that \u25a0-the locker space is free, and although students must put a quarter in the locker to get the key out to lock it, 'the money is returned when the key is reined. If students leave . their backpacks umttended anywhere on campus, Berrett warned, the odds are the packs will be stolen. Students should take their backpadts with them or have someone they know watch the packs while they\u2019re gone, said Berrett.",
