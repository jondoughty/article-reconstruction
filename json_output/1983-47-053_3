Jim Austin's letter on the antiwar movement {Mustang Daily 1/11/83) was disappointing but unsurprising. It was disappointing in the sense that he revealed a complete lack of ' understanding of tbs antiwar movement; it was unsurprising in that he merely reflected the predominantly conservative attitudes that accompany a widespread political unconsciousness. His criticism of the movement begins, of course, with gross oversimpliBcations of its belief and attitudes. He mistakenly characterizes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peace\u00e2\u20ac\u009d movement as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hate\u00e2\u20ac\u009d movement by saying that iwotestors hated everyone over 30, that minority groups hated whites, that women's liberationists hated men, that ecologists hated science and technology, etc. Hue series of assertions is prejudicial, blatantly false, and based upon a shallow examination of the facts. Protestors did not hate everyone over 30; they hated shortsighted, warmongering policies that were 1) established by local, state, and national governments, 2) rooted in self-interest and self-aggrandizement. 3) philosophically grounded in the specious post-WW II belief that America was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the protector of the FVee World,\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 and 4) usually formed by middle-aged men. Minorities did not hate whites; they hated the prejudice and discrimination that were levied against them by whites. Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liberstionists did not hate men; they hated the traditional belief system (fostered by men) that locked them into roles as housewives and baby machines. The ecology movement did not (and does not) hate science and technology; it hates the unthinking use of science and technology to the detriment of our precariously-balanced ecosystem. These were and are the real issues, and they sould not be obscured by flippant, coercive rhetoric. Further, although it is true (as Austin implies) that some factions of the antiwar movement were composed of radical \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fringe\u00e2\u20ac\u009d groups-the Weather Underground and the Black Panthers, for example-the movement as a whole cannot be characterized by their activities any more than the Republicans can be characterized by the actions and beliefs of Jerry Falwell or Anita Bryant (or even Richard Nixon). Confusing the mwits of an issue with the character of one of its spokesmen shows weak thinking. something Mr. Austin de^nstrates repeatedly. Perhaps the most blatant example of this is found in his concluding paragraph. Ignoring for the moment Austin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indirect assertion that McGovern lost the 1972 election because the antiwar movement supported him (again, an extreme oversimplification of the facts), and also ignoring Austin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather bizarre assumption that electing Nixon was a testament to the wisdom of the American public, we are left with his statement that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the abolishing of the military draft and President Nixon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wind down of the Vietnam War took much of the wind from the sails of the movement.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Think about it. This is equivalent to saying that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153granting women the vote took much of the wind from the sails of the suffrage movement.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122!| That makes sense; when you accomplish your goals, there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much need to continue pursuing them. Face it. The antiwar movement was a success. Despite Nixon's invasion (whoops, I mean \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incursion\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) into Cambodia and his rhetoric about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peace with honor\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honorable withdrawal\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (slogans even mme mindless than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153love and peace\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), the weight and strength of Amwican opinion was overwhelmingly against the war, and American opinion forced him to mid it. Contending that the American public ignored, loathed, and despised the antiwar movement (as Austin does) ignores historical fact and the flow of current events. Well, some people still believe that the world is shaped like a pancake, so I guess anything is possible.",
