Cal Poly sends about 100 students to overseas universities each year through the California State Univeraity system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s International Programs. Last year 96 studmts from Cal Poly spent a year at an overseas campus through the foreign study program. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just for rich Idds,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 said Holly White, past Alumni Assistant at the Cal Poly ' bran^ of the program. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for swious students who also have a sense of adventure.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 White said most foreign study programs involve European universities. The most popular and competitive programs overseas we in ajxhitecture and business. White said Cal Poly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength in these two majors \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 accounts for the high proportion of students from this campus who are selected for foreign study programs. Students can study at universities in 15 different countries through CSU International Programs. Depending on the foreign university they want to attend, students must have at least a 2.75 or a S.OO GPA. Students must also have junior standing by the time thsy intend to leave for overseas study in order to be considered for the program. All units named abroad will transfer back to CSU campuses, and any financial aid students received in CaUfomia can be applied to overseas study. The cost of a year of overseas study for a student dspends on the cost of living in the country. It ranges from 94,500 for a year in Mezko to 98,000 for a year in Danmark, according to Joanns LeBaron, this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alumni Assistant for the program. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It also depends on the extracurricular activities that go along with studies,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d shsadded. White and LeBaron both said a ymr of study at a foreign university impresses proqwctive empk>3rers and helps students get into graduate schools. Experience in a foreign culture and in foreign studies is something most people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have, LeBaron stressed. Students whose majors and career goals would best coordinate with overseas university study programs are most likely to be accepted to the international study program, LeBaron said. To bs chosen for the program, students must apply and are then interviewed, indents who want to study at universities in Spain, France, Peru or Brazil must have two years of college study in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s language.
