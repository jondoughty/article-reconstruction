    "article_text": "This time of year, the bright clusters of monarch butterflies adorning eucalyptus boughs south of Pismo Beach look more like like huge clumps of orange leaves than collections of insects. Wliile the butterflies hang in filtered sunlight, members of Cal Poly’s biological sciences department conduct studies that may help scientists understand more about the migration and habits of the delicate travelers, some of whom have flown in from as far away as Canada. “This is our own research project,” said Kingston Leong, an instructor in the biological sciences department. “Initially we started with the state parks; now we’re doing it on our own just to unravel things. It’s like a puzzle — the more we unravel, the moi'e we find out.” Leong said that each fall monarchs fi’om east of the Rocky Mountains head south toward central Mexico. “That is the main population, close to five or six million.” Butterflies native to the western side of the Rockies head toward California, nesting just north of San Francisco and down tlie coast as far south as BajiT California, Leong said. “The theory is that they tend to escape the (weather) extremes of the central states,” Leong said. “Certain areas, I think, are like a funnel due to wind pat- terns or whatever. It is my theory that when they hit the coast they tend to look for areas to cluster.” Leong said the butterflies tend to gather in little groves, and this is one of the heaviest See Bl.T l KRFLIKS, page 12 areas for migrating monarchs. Leong said about 300,000 of the colorful insects will spend the winter in the trees along Highway 1, enjoying their protection and the mild climate. “The ones born in the winter have a life span of about seven months. They will spend their winter here. Then, as they head north in the spring, they lay eggs along the way and die. “The progeny will emerge, mate, lay eggs and leapfrog their way north, generation after generation.” Leong said the summer butterflies live only a month or two. The ongoing studies include measurements of wind velocity, relative humidity and temperature at ground level as compared to those at the height of the clustered Monarchs in the trees. Using a telescopic aluminum pole with monitoring devices attached at the top, researchers can reach up to the level of the tightly-grouped butterflies. Identical devices record the same information at ground level. Leong and his students then enter the readings into a portable computer. Leong said this data should help determine why butterflies group at certain levels on the trees. Also, Leong calculates the height of the clusters to find the range of the groups on the trees. Leong said biological sciences professor Dennis Frey, also involved in the studies, catches and tags specimens in the Pismo trees. So far, over 1,000 butterflies have been marked. They are painted in one cell of the black, skeleton-like framework of the wings. “The tagging is twofold,” Leong said. “One is to see the behavior of the butterflies, to see if they stay here or move to another area. And since we have a coding system, we can tell, for instance, whether males cluster higher than females and how they distribute themselves.” Trails through the tall eucalyptus trees provide visitors with a look at the specimens. Orange County resident Mark Adler and his family made a point of stopping to see the butterfly trees. “It’s amazing to see so many in one place,” he said. “I thought they hung around backyards all the time.”",
