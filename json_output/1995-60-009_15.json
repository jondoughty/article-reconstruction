    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — It is distressing for any parent to have a teen-aged child cited by police for drinking. For a high-profile family like Vice President A1 Gore’s, things are hardly helped by having it all played out in public. Tipper Gore said Ibesday their 16-year-old daughter, given a ticket last weekend, is wrestling with the public attention as well as \"the severe disappointment of her family and friends and herself.” Sarah Gore was cited Friday in suburban Montgomery County, Md., after a police officer saw her holding an open beer while sitting in a car outside a party. The driver of the car was not drinking. Civil citations also were issued to several other juveniles, police say. The maximum penalty for underage possession is $500. The family is dealing with Sarah’s situation privately, Mrs. Gore said, “talking to her like all families should to their teenagers about the availability of alcohol and the fact the temptations are out there.” “She broke our rules and she broke the law. She’s extremely miserable and unhappy, I can tell you that,” Mrs. Gore said in an interview on Fox Morning News. But Mrs. Gore — a staunch supporter of drug and alcohol education efforts — also lamented the public attention. “Not only does she have to deal with the severe disappoint- ment of her family and friends and herself, she has to deal with the news media’s attention too. And she’s only 16 years old,” Mrs. Gore said. The Gores’ situation underscores how pervasive teen-age drinking is in America. “The vice president and Mrs. Gore are in good company. Literally hundreds of thousand of American households are facing the same problem,” said Doug Hall,' vice president of the Parents Resource Institute for Drug Education. According to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence Inc., 87 percent of high school seniors have used alcohol, and two-thirds of teenagers who drink say they can buy their own.",
