    "article_text": "Talk about a misunderstanding. But why? They certainly didn’t know why, because they couldn’t communicate. Maybe it was impossible for them to understand each other, and too easy not to give a damn. We’re lucky to have the hindsight that history gives us. It’s a silly world we live in. independent black state/culture. I call upon him now, and all those who read his opinion, to carefully consider what he is saying and proposing. Consider the following: An independent black state seems like a good escape from too many years of abuse, humiliation, and discrimination. But, it is a regeneration and perpetuation of the same ignorance which created the state of \"blackness” today. It calls for conquest, separatism, the exclusion of other races from black culture, and depriving the rest of us of their input to our culture. This is quite clearly the oppv>site of what Dr. King would have proposed, and the opposite of what those who strive for equality would like to see. Not only is it a continuation of racism in a new form, it is the primary cause of failure in the fight for equality. It shares the same failure of the ERA and gay-rights movements. Each of these groups have worked toward their own liberation, failing to understand the concept \"equality.” Equality in the eyes of the law, and, more importantly, in our minds, must come to mean equality for human beings, regardless of their attributes. This is the equality which Dr. King wanted. The future along Thomas’ path would be one of conquest. counter-conquest, and counterconquest, continuing in a never-ending fashion as in the middle cast. The future along a path of equality is bleak at first, but comes out nice in the end. The bleakness comes out of the question of \"how?” How do we achieve change in the minds of bigots? Working together, all the oppressed and enlightened members of the oppressing groups, we can change the culture as a whole. As a function of time, this world will become one culture, as we are one creature. The question of \"how?” brings us back to integration. Certainly as an institution it has been far from ideal. But to call it the \"slave philosophy of self hate” is equally far from accurate. It was an attempt to begin the process of the concept of “integration” — also known as accommodation. The legal bans on discrimination are but one front of many in the war for equality of humans. Working toward integration is working toward a common culture, toward everlasting peace among mankind. To become one culture, yours must admit that of mine, and mine must admit that of yours. If you choose to go your own way, excluding me (or vice-versa) how can we come together? Bigotry is borne of ignorance, of lack of knowledge of one another. Separatism perpetuates bigotry — see South Africa and its separate black nation states. To work toward distinct cultures based on the color of the skin (or any other attribute) is counter-productive and working toward everlasting hell. I hope that the views of Mr. Thomas are not that of the Afro-American Student Union. I hope they do not support separatism, counter-racism, and ignorance as he does. If they do, then they have a nice counterpart in the white bigot culture known as the KKK. Finally, Thomas gives halfhearted praise of Dr. King. His opinion was less a discussion of King than a discussion of his own fanaticism. King was clearly a great leader of our nation (not just one race), a man way ahead of his time. He was a man dedicated not to overcoming the white man, but rather to overcoming ignorance and discrimination. He believed in the goodness of the white man only as part of his belief in the goiKiness of mankind. He was a man who lived to improve his world rather than just to turn the tables. He lived by a philosophy of forgiveness, and love for mankind — in all its forms. King’s dream can be expressed as \"one world, one people.” Not everyone is cut out to change the world. After ail. it takes education, skills and a spare two years. Also a willingness to work. Hard. This year 3.750 Americans will join the Peace Corps to do just that. They'll do things like build roads, plant forests and crops, teach English, develop small businesses, train conv munity health workers, or even coach basketball. However, what they'll be doing isn't half as important as the fact that they'll be changing a little piece of the world...for the better. And when they return, these 3,750 Americans will find that experience doing hard work will have another benefit. It's exactly what their next employers are looking for. So, give the Peace Corps your next two years. And while you're out changing the world, you'll also be making a place in it for yourself. Only at Wells Fargo Bank.
