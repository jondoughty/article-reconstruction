    "article_text": "It sure doesn’t figure, but the No. 12 Cal Poly Mustangs have a legitimate shot at winning the national title. The upset-minded Mustangs will take on the No. 7 Sonoma State Cossacks at 5 p.m. tonight in the semifinals of the NCAA Division II national championships. The game, the first of two semifinal contests, will be held in Melbourne, Fla. Little more than one month ago, the Mustangs crawled into the playoffs by narrowly beating Grand Canyon University, 1-0, at Mustang Stadium. Since then. Poly has played two dramatic nail-biters on the road — each ending in Mustang victories. The first was a 1-0 decision over San Bernardino, which had beat Poly earlier in the season. The Mustangs then became the first Division II sch(X)l to beat the No.3-ranked Seattle Pacific Falcons in two years. Poly barely beat the Falcons, 4-3. Tonight, Poly finds itself in the Final Four in a very familiar role — an underdog on the road. Poly has offensive weapons in Todd Henry (15 goals, 7 assists), Ryshiem Henderson (10 goals, 16 assists) and Lorenzo Cremona (12 goals, 8 assists). Here’s a brief list of the Final Four teams: •\tNo. 12-ranked Cal Poly Mustangs (14-4-4) — The Mustangs have earned a bid to the Final Four after two wins on the road — a 1-0 victory over San Bernardino and a 4-3 decision over Seattle Pacific. •\tNo. 7-ranked Sonoma State Cossacks (17-3-2) — The Cossacks got to the semis by beating Oakland, 3-2, in overtime and the University of Missouri, St. Louis, 3-1, in St. Louis. Sonoma and Poly have played four common opponents. Poly was 3-0-1 against them and Sonoma was 6-1-0. The Cossacks are led by senior Andrew Ziemer, with 26 goals and 13 assists. •\tNo. 1-ranked Florida Tech Panthers (17-2-1) — The Panthers are in the Final Four after beating Tampa, 2-1, in the second round. The Panthers are led by sophomore Richard Sharpe with 39 goals and 13 assists in 20 games this season. •\tNo. 4-ranked Franklin Pierce Ravens (18-3-1) — The Ravens are in the semis after beating Keene State, 2-0 at home. The Ravens are led by Bojan Vuckovic with 20 goals and six assists in 21 games.",
