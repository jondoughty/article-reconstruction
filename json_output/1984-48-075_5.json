    "article_text": "   The Student Senate tonight is voting on a Pasco Package which would send a message to the California Legislature that Cal Poly students support the Legislature’s peace resolution.    If the Student Senate passes the Peace Package said Julie Clayton, author of the resolution and senator from Human Development and Education, it would send e letter to Sen Lula Obispo’s representatives that 16,000 students support the Legislature’s resolution.    The Legislature’s resolution, if passed, would tend s message to the United States Senate urging them to call for the immediate halt to the deployment of nuclear weapons.    The resolution also calls for a letter to be sent to Congress and the President of the United States urging them to increase peace making efforts and dialogue in order to decrease United States/Soviet Union tension. ( One reason for her resolution was to increase the knowledge of Student Senators, she said. “My underlying purpose is to increase the awareness of the Student Senate, councils and dubs.’’    When a resolution or bill is introduced she said, the senate, the student councils and dubs must study the proposal and this increases their awareness of the social issues.    Many senators have been critical of resolutions which do not directly relate to education, calling for the senate to address issues which only affect students’ education.    “I don’t think my resolution will pass,” said Clayton. “Because there is a lot of confusion among Student Senators as to their roles as senators and citizens of the United States.’’    Clayton said that she will continue to introduce tjills and resolutions which are of great importance to Cel Poly students as citizens of the United States.    “I’m not pushing my political viewpoints on anyone,’’ Please era page 9   As Student Senators from the School of Human Development and Education we wish to address your Feb. 6,1964 Opinion page calling us ASInine. To begin with, let us set the record straight. The Editorial Board stated that “...only one fourth of the 24 senators have even introduced bills. The remaining bills ware authored by ASI officers, who cannot even vote on them “ You are correct in stating that a small percentage of senators have introduced bills. The majority of business that is conducted at the senate meetings is in the form of rssolutitms and not bills. We might aimast that you know the difference between thetwobeforeyougo writing with an “ignorant’’pan.   As far as the senate evaluation form is concerned, we agree with the Editorial Board. It was ASInine. I, Julie Clayton, along with half the other aehators felt that filling out the evaluation form Would not be a “worthwhile invsetment of our time.’’   The Daily abo suggesta that “perhapa student senators need to have their qualifications checked before they are oven allowed to run for office.” The point is writ taken but what type of qualifications are   As far as genie being set; we can only speak for ourselves. I feel that I have obtained essay of my goele as an ASI Student Senator. My foremost goal waa to ding of events at Cal Poly. I have spoken out on ASI funds being allocated to put on a “tailgate” party and also ASI funds spent to fly not one but two ASI officers to the East Coast for lobbying purposes. • }    My fellow student senator, Donna TsnigucbL feels that the objective that she has wanted to address was that of increasing tha awareness of our student body on the current issues being dealt with. One important approach is communicating this to students through the student councils.    We have also set up a \"inset your ASI Senator’’ Day. During this day, we met with our constituents end passed out information on such things as the new add/drop policy and voter registration.    I have, along with the help of the Student Senate, surveyed 600 Cal Poly students in order to find out how they would like to eee their commencement ceremony run. From the results of the survey. I introduced and had passed a resolution reflecting the majority's opinion.    Finally. I have spent a day at our State Capitol lobbying for an increase in funding for the California State University System’s budget. Hie list goes on and on but perhaps we would not need to waste the ink on this page ifthe Editorial Board had cared enough to sit in on one of our many senate meetings in order to find out what we were up to.    The Student Senate meets for a formal masting every Wednesday night form 7 pjn.en.1 can roeatiene meeting in which the Student Senate eat from 7 p.m. til midnight discussing pertinent, issues that would affect the Cel Poly student body. We meet (informally) every Monday night to debate raoohitions and bills before they are brought to the Wednesday night-meeting. We aleo attend our school council meetings and ait on various risnriiag committees such as: In-structkmally Related Activities Board (which extends fund to the Mustang DetfyA Codes and Bylaws and the Academic Committee.    What does this all add up to? Roughly. 10 to 20 hours of voluntary service to the ASI. What do we receive in return? A slap in the face from the Editorial Board of tha Mustang Daily!

The Cal Poly women’s basketball team had the home crowd on ita feet at the end of Thursday night’s game agtinst Cal State Loe Angeles.    Senior guard Kelly Ulrich provided the drama when she dropped in a 10-footer with two seconds'left on the clock to win the game, 68-66.    “I thought there was one second on the clock,” said Ulrich. .\"1 just kind of threw it. I knew it had to go in.”    Chris Hester put the first point on the board for the Mustangs with a free throw, followed by two buckets from Sue Farmer.    Despite top-scorer Terrie Mac Donald’s 13 consecutive points (of a game-high 27 points) Cal Poly trailed the (iolden Eagles 35-38, at the half The second half had more back-and-forth court action than a tennis match, when both teams alternated taking the lead, although never building up anything substantial With 53 seconds left on the clock and the score tied at 64-64. the Lady Mustangs called a time-out. When the team hit the court, the rally began again, with Sherrie Atteberry\" pulling   do*m A rebound and totting the half to center Nancy Hoskan for two points. 4 1 ■ Cal' State LA’s giiard from down ', under, Jann Martin, contributed two points to tie the score again at 6846.
