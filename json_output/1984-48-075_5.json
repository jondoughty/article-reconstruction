    "article_text": "  As Student Senators from the School of Human Development and Education we wish to address your Feb. 6,1964 Opinion page calling us ASInine. To begin with, let us set the record straight. The Editorial Board stated that “...only one fourth of the 24 senators have even introduced bills. The remaining bills ware authored by ASI officers, who cannot even vote on them “ You are correct in stating that a small percentage of senators have introduced bills. The majority of business that is conducted at the senate meetings is in the form of rssolutitms and not bills. We might aimast that you know the difference between thetwobeforeyougo writing with an “ignorant’’pan.   As far as the senate evaluation form is concerned, we agree with the Editorial Board. It was ASInine. I, Julie Clayton, along with half the other aehators felt that filling out the evaluation form Would not be a “worthwhile invsetment of our time.’’   The Daily abo suggesta that “perhapa student senators need to have their qualifications checked before they are oven allowed to run for office.” The point is writ taken but what type of qualifications are   As far as genie being set; we can only speak for ourselves. I feel that I have obtained essay of my goele as an ASI Student Senator. My foremost goal waa to critically analyse the ASI Finance Committee's fun- ding of events at Cal Poly. I have spoken out on ASI funds being allocated to put on a “tailgate” party and also ASI funds spent to fly not one but two ASI officers to the East Coast for lobbying purposes. • }    My fellow student senator, Donna TsnigucbL feels that the objective that she has wanted to address was that of increasing tha awareness of our student body on the current issues being dealt with. One important approach is communicating this to students through the student councils.    We have also set up a \"inset your ASI Senator’’ Day. During this day, we met with our constituents end passed out information on such things as the new add/drop policy and voter registration.    I have, along with the help of the Student Senate, surveyed 600 Cal Poly students in order to find out how they would like to eee their commencement ceremony run. From the results of the survey. I introduced and had passed a resolution reflecting the majority's opinion.    Finally. I have spent a day at our State Capitol lobbying for an increase in funding for the California State University System’s budget. Hie list goes on and on but perhaps we would not need to waste the ink on this page ifthe Editorial Board had cared enough to sit in on one of our many senate meetings in order to find out what we were up to.    The Student Senate meets for a formal masting every Wednesday night form 7 pjn.en.1 can roeatiene meeting in which the Student Senate eat from 7 p.m. til midnight discussing pertinent, issues that would affect the Cel Poly student body. We meet (informally) every Monday night to debate raoohitions and bills before they are brought to the Wednesday night-meeting. We aleo attend our school council meetings and ait on various risnriiag committees such as: In-structkmally Related Activities Board (which extends fund to the Mustang DetfyA Codes and Bylaws and the Academic Committee.    What does this all add up to? Roughly. 10 to 20 hours of voluntary service to the ASI. What do we receive in return? A slap in the face from the Editorial Board of tha Mustang Daily!    Julie Clayton Dsana Tanlgndri Editors note:    The Mustang Daily is completely self-sufficient and is supported only by those revenues it generates in advertising. None of its funding comes from IRA, as erroneously stated in the above letter. L          ;    And once again you have missed the point of the editorial Speahing out against an action is fine and dandy, but what specific actions (resolutions do not count — they're merely recommendations) hew the Student Senate accomplished which hew directly affected the student body of Cal Pofyl",
