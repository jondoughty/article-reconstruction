Six students are running for the position; Kevin Fox, Tyler Hammond, Mike Hogan, Steve Johnson, David Kaminskas and Kevin Swanson. Both students and administrators expressed that an increased awareness and concern about student government has had an impact on the amount of interest in the election. \u201cThe participation in the election is a tion of how productive repecti( has been this year, and students want to get involved,\u201d said Tyler Hammond, presidential candidate. Roger Conway, director of the University Union, said people are realizing ASI is a student corporation for the benefit of students. ASI servica and programs control S3 million a year. \u201cLegaily, they (presidents) have responsibilities that most people don\u2019t have until they tuve been out of school for 10 years,\u201d he said. Stan Van VIeck, a candidate for ASI vice president, believa the number of students running for president wiU encourage the student body to become involv- ed. \u201cEviery vote will make a difference, especially in this year\u2019s election,\u201d he said. Because so many people are running tor office, Kaminskas, a presidential candidate, anticipates a run-off. The problem with having a run-off el^on is students assume a candidate wili win because be had the most votes in the first round. StudenU fail to vote in the run-off election, resulting in poor student representation, Kaininskas said. The six candidates will talk about student issues on KCPR radio from 7 to 9 p.m. Tuesday. Listener phone calls will be taken on the air.",
