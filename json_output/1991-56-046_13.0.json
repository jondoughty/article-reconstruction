    "article_text": "Did you know Jesus Christ was a Capricorn with Sagittarian tendencies? He was reportedly bom on Dec. 25, which puts him at the beginning of Capricorn, but close to the end of Sagittarius. Rumor has it that he was actually born in August, and he is really a Leo. But I like to think he was a Capricorn. That same rumor says that they chose Dec. 25 as his birthday because it would make for a nice convenient holiday in the middle of winter. I don’t believe it, though, because I am a Capricorn born the day after Christmas and, well, it’s comforting to know that Jesus had a rotten birthday too. For those Christmas babies out there, you know what I am talking about! It is a special curse that is beset on us from the instant we are delivered. Your birthday is inconsequential compared to Christmas. You want presents, well too bad. No one can remember your birthday and even if they could they wouldn’t be able to afford it. “What do you need birthday presents for, you’ve got Christmas presents?” I get that all the time. Or they say, “This is your Christmas and birthday present!” Yeah right. Don’t let them get away with it. Fight back. Fam.ily, friends and acquaintances have no right to ignore and overlook us during the holidays. Don’t they realize that the highest suicide rates are during Christmas? I would also venture to guess that most of these miserable unfortunates are Capricorns or Sagittaria ns. I have a solution. I just buy myself things at Christmas and tell people that their birthday presents were also their Christmas presents and they should be glad. If you get frustrated or depressed during the holiday, due to your untimely birthday, just remember what it means to be a Capricorn. Capricorns are half goat and half fish (not a pretty animal, but a successful one). They are the sign of ambition and loyalty and they look good in red and green. They are also stingy capitalists and you can see why. It all stems from a deprived childhood. Let’s not forget that Christmas babies are also Sagit-tarians, or Capricorns with Sagittarian tendencies. Sagittarius is half horse, half man and carries a bow and arrow. A much more pleasing animal to look at than the Capricorn (that’s where I get my good looks). They have a zest for life and are one of the most understanding and easygoing signs (that’s where I get my laziness). Anyhow, you combine the two and you have a perfectly balanced person with the best of both worlds. So what if you get jipped every year? These are characterbuilding experiences that you should be grateful for. It is nothing a lifetime of therapy can’t fix!",
