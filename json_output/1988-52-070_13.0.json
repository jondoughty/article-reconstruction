    "article_text": "The Cal Poly baseball team showed an impressive display of power as it swept a doubleheader from Cal State Hayward Saturday afternoon at Sinsheimer Stadium. The Mustangs dominated both games, taking the first, 6-1, and exploding in the second, 12-5. Cal Poly improved its record to 3-2, while Hayward fell to 0-3. In the first game, Hayward had 10 hits, but couldn’t capitalize on the opportunities as they stranded seven runners. Cal Poly designated hitter Gary Renko had two hits and one RBI, and second baseman Joe Rumsey added two hits. Game two was one to watch under the sunny skies of a beautiful day. The Mustangs jumped off to a quick start as Hayward starter • Steve Moen didn’t make it past the first inning. Hayward got two quick runs on a fielding error by center-fielder Rich Sheppard in the second inning, but the Mustangs hadn’t even started. In the bottom half of the inning Cal Poly third baseman Willie Clemens jumped on reliever Sean Sexton for a double off the leftfield wall. Sexton soon found himself in trouble as he loaded the bases twice and walked in a run. Cal Poly came away with three runs. The third frame was no different as Cal Poly had another See BASEBALL, page 6 big inning. The big producer was Sheppard, who atoned for his error by smashing a two-run homer over the leftfield wall. It was part of a five-run inning that resulted in another pitching change for Hayward State. The Pioneers brought in lefthander Don Santos, but by the top of the fourth. Cal Poly led by five runs. The Mustangs scored three more over three innings to clinch the game. Cal Poly starter Lee Hancock pitched a complete game, getting seven strikeouts and allowing five walks. He improved his record to 2-0. Sheppard was the Mustangs’ leading hitter going into the series, batting .500. He had no hits in the first game, but finished the second with two hits and three RBI. Rumsey also had a good second game, connecting for two hits and two RBI. Clemens, Rumsey and Drew Herron all had doubles in the second game. The Mustangs hosted Hayward in a single game yesterday. They will be at home again next weekend, when they host a three-game series against San Jose State. The doubleheader on Saturday begins at noon and the game on Sunday starts at 1 p.m.",
