    "article_text": "William Golding aptly wrote of man’s return to his natural state of barbarism when devoid of authority. We remember his book, “Lord of the Flies,” a story of boys shipwrecked on an island who resort to violence and the idolatry of a conch shell to celebrate their independence and paganism. Golding’s basis in truth not only recalled man’s history but prophesied spring break 1986 across the country. A similar scenario to that deserted island somewhere in the Pacific took place in Palm Springs, California, U.S.A. Thousands of students across the country, including Cal Poly students (and you know who you are) washed up on the sandy desert terrain: released victims of a quarter of classes and a week of finals.

Rampant sex and lewd conduct startled none as the fourth, fifth and sixth days of spring break came and went. And on the seventh day they rested, more out of sheer physical exhaustion than peace. Having conquered the land, they were happy. The cars were loaded up with the remains of belongings and friends and headed back to their respective schools. Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, one of them. Perhaps it is the blonde student utting next to you in speech class who wore no top in a convertible down the main drag of Palm Springs. Perhaps it is the freckle-faced woman sitting behind you in calcuhis class who tore off her shirt. You may never know, as authority has once again imposed a semblance of calm over the university.",
