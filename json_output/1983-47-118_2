    "article_text": "Calculators and mechanical pencils are sharing space lately with literary masterpieces in the backpacks of some Cal Poly engineering majors. They are men and women with technical majors going for something extra in the English department minor program. Approximately one-third of the 65 English minors at Cal Poly are engineering majors, according to Michael Orth, coordinator and advisor for the year-old program. Sometimes the load of 27 additional units costs those students an extra quarter or two, but for a variety of reasons they feel the investment of time and effort is worth it. \"Some students feel an English major is not a viable option career-wise, but in engineering they are thirsting in a desert of numbers,\" Orth said. \"For those students. English classes are a refreshing change.\u201d Then, too, there is the potential career leverage the minor might give an engineering major. \"The English minor may also give students more flexibility in their profession,\" said Orth. \"TTiere is a problem with illiteracy in business and industry. There is room for people who can write a report or make sense of what others may have written.\" Robert Valpey, Dean of the School of Engineering and Technology, agrees with Orth. \"In any and every business. including engineering, the need for communication skills stands out as absolutely essential for advancing in one's career,\" said Valpey. \"Where an English minor may aid in honing those communiction skills, then it is indeed a valuable thing to have,\" he said. The course requirements within the English minor includes Shakespeare, American and Victorian literature, advanced composition and English grammar. ' The program, which started winter quarter of 1982, is drawing about 20 sign-ups each quarter, but Orth said he\u2019d be happy to see 200 more in the program. At least three of the engineering majors see the career benefits and the change of pace from their major as reasons for minor-ing in English. Roger Hand, a senior Electronic Engineering major said he became aware of the minor program through posters in the English building. \"1 looked at the classes 1 would have to take, and found out I would have taken most of them out of interest anyway. If I wasn't interested in English in the first place, I wouldn\u2019t have signed up for the minor. \u2019Thrfact that it can help me career-wise is just a fringe beneftt,\u201d said Hand. Hand said he reads books and writes m his free time, but taking an English class forces him to set aside the time to pursue it. \u201cYou might say it gives me an excuse to take up some time with reading,\u201d he said. \"Another factor is that the poeple in English classes are diff\u00e9rait from those in engineeriqg classes, and it\u2019s good to mingle with different kinds of people,\u201d Hand said: Another Electronic Engineeing senior. Sean McNally, said English classes offer a nice Change of pace, and could provide him with communication skills important in his field. \u201cTve been told by some professors that engineers in the field have trouble because they have good ' ideas but they can\u2019t com-I munieata them. There\u2019s a good chance that communication skills will become important in management positions 1 might want to pursue.\u201d McNally said. McNally also cited the importance of having a minor in English included on his resume. \u201cIt\u2019s better to go into an interview with a resume that shows an English i minor ratha* than just telling the interviewer I took a ' lot of English classes,\u201d he said. Stuart Allen, a| sophomore Metallurgical Engineering major, is minoriu in Philosophy m weD as English. \u2022\u2018Oem^ education is important to have.\u201d Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look at everything from an engineering standpmnt. \"Phil08(^liy is a way of thinking, and English is a way of expressing myself. These . will both be necessary parts of working for myself, which I want to do, eventually.\u201d And, of course, for Allen there is the enjoyment of reading and writing; the break from engineering classes. \u201dIt\u2019s nice to sit down and havt to read a book.\u201d Allen said. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say English is a bed of roses, though. I have tb work at it. too. It\u2019s like anything else: you get out of it what you put into it.\u201d ,",
