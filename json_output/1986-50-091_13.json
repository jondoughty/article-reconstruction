Venture Architects, a conglomeration of two local Arms, was given the contract last December. It marks the first time in Cal Poly history that a local firm has been given a nujor design project. The new building will be located in the parking lot in front of the Campus Store, near the Robert E. ~ Kennedy Library. It will cost an estimated S3.5 million and incorporate a 'nostalgic, look to Mend in wteh tome of the older structures on **We were anxious to do a building that wouldf' attempt to tie in the traditional architectural ekmenti, such as sloping roofs, making our building fit in what we caO a particular architectural vocabulary,** said MacIntyre. He added that Georgs Hasslein, a professor in the architecture department, was instrumental in getting the contract for his firm. MacIntyre added that his l*s proposal is S300,000 lower the SS.I million allocated by the state. \"We*rt real bulbah in wanting peopk to know that the low bidder oa the project wm ^00,000 below our budget, so k nukes us look like real heroes,** said MacIntyre. Among the other Cal Poly graduates to work oa the project is Daniel Clark, who graduated in 1971. Clark was the project coordinator in charge of the actual drawing of the design. He worked for a Los Angeles-based firm for six years before coming bock to San Luis Obispo two years ago. Another Cal Poly graduate, Andrew Blasjo, and a current Cal Poly student, Tim Schulze, were responsible for doing the brimt of the drawings. Blasjo, a 1980 graduate, said training at Cal Poly gave them a good foundation for understanding some of the particular aspeett of the bunding. However, Schulze, who is expecting to graduate next year, added that there should be more emphasis put on actual work experience essential for al working architects. **I think more people should be involved in actually working in the field while they’re going to school, so they can see what it*s about rather than graduating and being totally disenchanted with what they’re doing.** Several other Cal Poly gradu- ates mere instnimental in helping with the design. Rod Levin, a 1938 graduate and George Stewart, a 1973 graduate, are also owners of the firm along with BBI Maul. They, along with MacIntyre, have taught at Cal Poly in recem years. The project arill take an estimated 18 months to flnith aad will requko the Venture Architects Arm as consultants until h is complesed. The project, which has been designed to fit in with the unique Cal Poly look, will also be a amatelpiece for some former Cal Poly students. “For nqrseif, being a student there aad havtaig done some of the work on it was exciting for me.** said Schulae. “And what 1 fed that I've done by working on the project is 'team by doing,’ which is the motto of Cal Poly.”",
