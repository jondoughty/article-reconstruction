    "article_text": "Editor \u2014 Mustang Daily (April 3) reported that the Cal Poly Foundation \"loaned\" $250,(XX) to the Intercollegiate athletic program and that the \"loan\" would be repayed by the general student body through fee Increases or higher prices at El Corral and Food Services. How can you call this a \"loan?\" It's a scami We, the students, haven't been asked (through referendum) If we want to raise our fees, and If we refuse to In the future they'll |ust raise prices at El Corral and Food Services to get our money that way. Maybe this \"creative financing\" wouldn't bother me so much If the money was to be spent in a way that benefitted the majority of Cal Poly students, but It won't be.
