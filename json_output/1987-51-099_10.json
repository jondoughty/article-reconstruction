    "article_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Reagan administration, while standing fast to its plans for sanctions on Japanese electronics imports, has agreed to a Japanese request for “emergency consultations’’ in the intensifying dispute over computer chips, U.S. officials said Wednesday. A team of Japanese trade specialists will arrive in Washington on Friday for negotiations with their counterparts in the departments of State, Commerce and office of U.S. trade representative, the officials said. The semiconductor talks, to get under way in earnest on Monday, will be followed later in the week with meetings in Washington among higher-level trade officials of both nations, government spokesmen said. HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) — A judge’s upholding of a surrogate parent contract in New Jersey after an Indiana judge ruled one invalid last year heightens the need for laws to clarify the sensitive issue, lawyers said Wednesday. “Surrogacy has potentially devastating civil liberties implications for all parties involved. We have to proceed very carefully and very thoughtfully,’’ said Susan Sangree, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Reproductive Freedom Project in New York City. Superior Court Judge Harvey R. Sorkow’s 121-page decision in the “Baby M’’ case Tuesday granted custody of the year-old girl known as Baby M to her father, William Stern. It denied parental rights to Mary Beth Whitehead, who had agreed to bear the child for Stern and his wife, Elizabeth, via artificial insemination. Mrs. Stern adopted the baby Tuesday. Attorneys for Whitehead, who had changed her mind after agreeing to a $10,000 surrogate contract, filed for a stay of the decision Tuesday. They said the case probably will be appealed directly to the New Jersey Supreme Court, and that arguments are expected within four months. Sorkow’s strongest message, legal experts said, was a call for help from the nation’s legislatures. No state regulates surrogate parenting. Sixteen states have delved into the issue, with bills either pending or defeat^ in their Legislatures. The New Jersey and Indiana rulings set precedents for those states only, but lawyers and judges can refer to them while considering similar cases nationwide. In the Indiana case, Superior Court Judge Victor S. Pfau invalidated a surrogate contract, saying fees paid to the surrogate mother constitute profiting from adoption, a Class D felony under state law. He ruled a mother cannot agree to give up her child until after birth. “1 think that there is always going to be a lot of conflicting law out there,’’ said Nadine Taub, a Rutgers University law professor. “This shows we need legislative clarification.’’ Sorkow called for laws to, establish standards for sperm donors, legitimacy of the child, and the rights of the parents’ spouses. He also suggested there should be laws to determine the qualifications of a surrogate, whether payment to the mother should be allowed and remedies if the child is born impaired. “It took years of legislative debate and judicial inquiry to define and develop today’s laws of abortion and artificial insemination,’’ Sorkow said. “The issues of surrogacy are still evolving, but it is necessary that laws be adopted to give our society a sense of definition and direction if the concept is to be allowed to further develop.’’ Attorneys agreed that most states will likely pass laws regulating surrogate motherhood.",
