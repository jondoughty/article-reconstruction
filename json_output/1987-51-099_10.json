    "article_text": "The Cal Poly women’s softball team split a doubleheader with Cal State Bakersfield on Tuesday. The Lady Mustangs won the first game 3-0 behind a strong pitching performance by freshman hurler Missy Bausch. Bausch limited the leagueleading Roadrunners to seven hits and no runs and allowed only two baserunners beyond first base the entire game. Bausch was backed up in the field by some fine defensive plays. Right fielder Michelle Gardiner made a diving catch that prevented an extra base hit in the third inning, while third baseman Shirley Tuttle made an excellent catch for the game’s final out. Cal Poly played an error-free game. Offensively, Cal Poly managed just five hits off Bakersfield’s Shannon Oaks, but two of them came in the fourth inning when the Mustangs broke a scoreless tie with a pair of runs. Mustang center fielder Penny Parker went 2-for-3 at the plate and had 2 RBIs. First baseman Ellen Clark also had a pair of hits. It was only the second loss in nine conference games for the first-place Roadrunners. The win improved the Mustangs’ league record to 5-3 and their overall record to 11-14. Cal Poly stranded 11 baserunners and committed four errors in the losing effort. The winning pitcher was Harvey while Lisa Ferguson suffered the loss for the Mustangs. The loss moves Cal Poly’s conference record to 5-4, and keeps them in third place behind Cal State Northridge and Cal State Bakersfield iw the California Collegiate Athletic Association.
