    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES — He never wore chain! in court, but as O.J. Simpson heard the words *Not guilty,” his was the face of a prisoner removing his shackles, a captive breathing the air of freedom. He sighed, pressed his hands together and smiled as a tide of emotions engulfed the courtroom of Judge Lance Ito. The wails of a victim’s relatives and the joyous gasps of Simpson’s mother, sisters and grown children broke the tense silence that preceded the reading of the jury’s ver> diet IViesday. For a moment, the judge’s clerk, Dierdre Robertson, had moved from her supporting role to the spotlight as she was called upon to read the two verdict forms. She stumbled on Simpson’s first name, Oren-thal, betraying the same nervousness that gripped everyone in the courtroom. Hers was the task of breaking a suspense which had intensified during 19 hours of cliff-hanger waiting for the verdicts to be announced. The two climactic words fell lightly from her lips but resonated with the power of a megaton bombshell: “Not guilty.” Simpson was now set free to pick up a life of privilege instead of a life in prison. Acquitted of murdering his ex-wife and her friend, he pledged to track down the real killers who are “out there somewhere.” Simpson smiled, mouthed the words, “Thank you,” at the jury, then clasped his hands together. Lead attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr., standing behind Simpson, slapped him on the back and laid his forehead on his shoulder. Attorney Shawn Chapman cried and clutched jury consultant Jo-Ellan Dimitri us’ hand. Tears of anguish and shouts of joy burst from the three families whose lives were tom apart by the bloody June 12, 1994, slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. “Oh my God!” exclaimed Simpson’s grown daughter, Amelle, embracing her brother Jason. “We did it!” a family member exulted to lead defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. Eerily, the Simpson saga ended much as it had begun, with the fidlen football superstar being transported in a white van to his estate while news helicopters tracked him overhead. Ibesday’s televised verdicts were the most-watched event since June 17,1994, when Simpson, in a white Bronco with his friend A1 “A.C.” Cowlings driving, led police on a surreal slow-speed chase viewed by millions. Cowlings was at the door to embrace Simpson when he arrived home about one hour after the verdicts were read. Later, family members gathered for a party on the lawn of Simpson’s lush estate. Florists, caterers and musicians pulled up to the house and told reporters surrounding the estate that they were there for a celebration. “Last June 13, *94 (the day he learned of his son’s death), was the worst nightmare of my life. This is the second,” Goldman’s father, Fred, said at a prosecution news conference. This prosecution team didn’t lose today. I deeply believe this country lost today. Justice was not served.” At a defense team news conference, Cochran insisted the issue of race, which he played heavily in the trial, did not overcome the facte. “This verdict speaks justice,” Cochran said. “This was a case based upon the From page 1 evidence.” He denied playing ”the race card,” saying instead that credibility had won out. ‘Race plays a part in everything in America,” he said. \"But this stuff about playing a race card is preposterous.” The bitter differences that were known to be racking the defense team diiring the trial finally erupted after the verdict when defense attorney Robert Shapiro, original architect of the Simpson strategy, blasted two Dream Team colleagues. He said Cochran ii\\jected race as an issue over his objections. ”Not only did they play the race card, but we dealt it from the bottom of the deck,” he told Barbara Walters in an interview for ABC News. Shapiro, who is Jewish, also said he was deeply offended by Cochran’s comparison of a detective to Adolf Hitler and told Cochran so. He said he would not work with Cochran again and his longtime friendship with F. Lee Bailey was shattered by the case and they would never speak again. Cochran said he hoped the Los Angeles Police Department would alter shoddy investigative practices exposed in the trial. As the words setting Simpson free were spoken in court, his elderly mother, Eunice, seated in a wheelchair, wiped her eyes, held up her hands prayerfully and murmured words of thanks. *I was always in prayer. I knew my son was innocent,” she said at the defense meeting with reporters. Across the room, Goldman mouthed the word ‘murderer” as the verdict was announced. Kim Goldman, who spent most of a year in court honoring her dead brother’s memory, doubled over and sobbed along with a younger brother and sister. At the courthouse, Simpson’s older son, Jason, read a statement from his father: ”My first obligation is to my young children, who will be raised the way that Nicole and I had always planned. ... But when things have settled a bit, I will pursue as my primary goal in life the killer or killers who slaughtered Nicole and Mr. Goldman. They are out there somewhere. Whatever it takes to identify them and bring them in, I will provide somehow.”",
