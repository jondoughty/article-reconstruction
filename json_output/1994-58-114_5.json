    "article_text": "We have trouble swallowing the idea that Judicial Affairs should even be serving judgement in this case, and, regardless, we think its solution is ludicrous. If what those band members wrote was obscene, libelous, or indecent, why can’t the dispute be settled in a public court? If it must be settled on campus, and libel or obscenity is shown, why did Judicial Affairs hand down such silly punishments? \"Bui the perverted minds that created the ‘Sousaphone’ were adult minds — at least legally. Why shouldn 7 they be treated like adults? Why aren’t adult laws and norms appropriate? And what justice has been served to the people ridiculed in the “Sousaphone?” They get a letter of apology. The same kind your first-grade teacher would make you write. But the perverted minds that created the “Sousaphone” were adult minds — at least legally. Why shouldn’t they be treated like adults? Why aren’t adult laws and norms appropriate? If a public court found the publication of the “Sousaphone” a hate crime — and it seems obvious it was created out of hate and ignorance — the students who created it would be doing a lot more than the juvenile punishments currently assigned to them. Hate crime is a serious offense that has no place at a university. Did a hate crime take place in the publication of the “Sousaphone?” Without a public trial, who’s to say? But based on Judicial Affairs’ resolution, this looks like a pretty trivial offense. But we’re not convinced. We saw the “Sousaphone.” We were disgusted. If we were the students whom the newsletter riduculed, we’d likely feel betrayed by the Judicial Affairs Department. As journalists, we would be the last to advocate a limit on legal free speech, but we must be fully aware of the laws that govern obscenity and libel. To hand down such a trivial punishment to the “Sousaphone” creators is to say that they are guilty, but not of a serious offense. We urge Judicial Affairs officials to make up its mind: Did a serious offense occur, or should the whole issue just be pushed aside? We hope they consider this the next time they are deciding an important campus issue — the victims of the “Sousaphone” deserve better.
