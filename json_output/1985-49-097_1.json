    "article_text": "Abolishing leftist governprients is the bottom line of the U.S. policy in Central America, a former New York Times reporter told a crowd of about 400 people Thursday night in Chumash Auditorium. Raymond Bonner, one of the first American journalists to report from behind the guerrilla lines in El Salvador, feels the United State's involvement in El Salvador is based on political ideologies. \"Forget about commercial economic interest or national security.” Bonner said. “W/e have no national reasons to go into El Salvador. The whole thing is based on ideology.\" Bonner's book. \"Weakness and Deceit — U.S. Policy in El Salvador, \" recently on the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, documenting the evolution of U.S. policy toward El Salvador. Bonner said the U.S. response to Nicaragua is to overthrow the Sandinistas, or have them \"cry uncle,\" Bonner said, quoting President Reagan in a recent press conference. Bonner described the U.S backed Contras as originally a band of misfits. \"The CIA took a rag-tag group of bandits and developied a very tough guerilla army, \" Bonner said. \"W'e've trainned them, given them equipment and even a manual in assassination.\" President Reagan called the Contras freedom fighters, but Bonner said he had some problems equating the Contras with America's founding fathers. \"1 don't recall the founding fathers raping and pillaging villages, slitting people's throats or having manuals to hire criminals to assassinate people.\" Bonner said there are many misconceptions regarding the Sandinista and Contra armies Stories of 100,000 Nicaraguan soldiers are false Bonner said. There are 40,000, which is 10,000 less than that of El Salvador. Other inaccuracies Bonner said, include the quality of weapons the Sandinistas are receiving, \"Tanks we're hearing about can't even make it up a small grade,\" Bonner said. \"And the Nicaraguan air force is a threat — to anyone that has to fly in their planes.\" In addition to the threat of Communism, Bonner said the United States is supporting El Salvador because America is told that Nicaragua is a totalitarian dungeon. Secretary of State George Shultz said the country was behind the iron curtain. Bonner posed the question, \"In what iron curtain country is there a newspaper that is vicious against the Sandinista government?\" \"Soviet entrepreneurs would salivate at the opportunities in Nicaragua,\" Bonner said. \"That's not to say Nicaragua is a democracy.\" Bonner feels the question is not what type of government a country has. but what right does the United States have to overthrow a political policy that does not agree with its own. Bonner said the best statement regarding U.S. foreign policy in El Salvador came from an P-piscopal bishop, who said, \"Our policy in Central America is illegal. inconsistent and ill-advised. In Central America we stand naked and ashamed before the nations of the world.\"",
