The Mustangs outscored Fresno Pacific in the non-conference matchup 105-97, in what Poly Head Coach SUwe Beason described as a fast-paced game. “Cal Poly has typically been a slow team, but this year we play much quicker,” Beason said. Poly’s high-scoring affairs can be at-tribuU'd to the fact that many freshman players that played together last year are back this year, Beason said. Poly, now 4-0, used a balanced offensive attack with seven players scoring in double figures. “It’s pretty tough for a team to load up on one guy when everyone on the floor is scoring,” Beason said. “That is probably the first time in 20 years that we have had seven guys in double digits.” Beason said the Mustangs don’t rely on one or two suj>erstars to carry the team. “We have a lot of good players, but we don't have any great players,” he said. In addition to the wide range of possible scorers. Poly can also score from any location on the court. The team sank 13 of its 19 attempts from three-point range and hit 50 percent of its field goal attempts. Bill Archer led the Mustangs with 18 points. Matt Clawson, Jeff Oliver, and Shawn Kirkeby added 17 points each for the Mustangs. David Delaney and Greg Paulson sunk 13 each.",
