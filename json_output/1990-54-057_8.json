This task force, which has representatives throughout the United States, is a means to assuring that store owners and consumers have safe and wholesome beef products. Algeo said the animal science industry has been a mature and stable industry. “You will see better products on the market that are consumer oriented — a product that’s as safe as humans can make it,” he said. Algeo said one of the most important things in the industry in years is to breed a leaner animal. “We produce a leaner, more healthier product than we have ever before,” Algeo said. “Today, there’s 2 to 7 percent fat content within a loin steak. In years past there’s been 20 to 25 percent fat content. There’s a push to produce a nutritionally dense product that’s high in vitamins, iron and protein.” Throughout his travels across the United States, Algeo has noticed that the one big question the consumer asks him is,“How come you use hormones and antibiotics in cattle?” Algeo said people are misinformed when told that the hormone estrogen could cause cancer. Estrogen production in the human male is 130,000 parts per billion (ppb) daily, said Algeo. In the nonpregnant female it’s from 200,000 to 1 million ppb’s daily. A steak from a non-implanted animal is about 2.4 ppb, and 3.2 for an implanted animal. “How can it be any big thing when a steer has only 3.2 ppb?” he said. “There’s a lot of false information on this. It is safe.” He said that less than 5 percent of beef producers are feeding antibiotics to their cattle. “There’s more effective ways than feeding antibiotics to cattle,” Algeo said. Antibiotics are used mainly when animals are sick, he said, adding that antibiotics are used to keep the animal alive. In addition, it costs too much to always feed the animals antibiotics. Algeo said the industry tries hard to meet stringent FDA and USDA standards. Algeo said he’s enjoyed working at Cal Poly and in the industry. “I tell my students to do something they like to do,” he said. “When you do something you like to do, you invariably do it well.” roup performs at two San Luis bispo clubs, Brubeck’s and K.’s West Indies Bar.

By age 30, Alexander the Great had conquered the known world. But it wasn't his resume that led him to victory. Instead, he possessed the ambition and perseverance of a dynamic leader. At Watkins-Johnson, it's that combination that drives our team to the fbrefiont of the elearonics industry. With over $292,000,000 In sales last year, we continued to excel in the design and manufacture of microwave components and systems. 1989 also brought the introduaion of over 115 new products used in a wide range of defense; communications and commercial applications.
