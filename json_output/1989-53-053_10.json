Do we as students of Cal Poly want to give visitors to our campus the impression that we don’t give a damn about our environment? Come on then. Quit taking it for granted that there’s always going to be someone around to pick up after you. Those who have gone before us have perhaps paid insufficient attention to the effects their actions have had on our environment, hence all the ecological problems we are faced with today.
