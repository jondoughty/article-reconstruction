Every year when Cal Poly students leave for the holidays, a large number of student residences are burglarized, said Steven Seybold, crime prevention coordinator at the San Luis Obispo Police Department. “It has become a major problem, especially in student housing,” Seybold said. “When everyone comes back, we get a flood of reports (that students have been burglarized).” Seybold said 138 thefts were reported by residents of off-campus student housing after last year’s holiday season. He also said that there were probably a large number of students who were burglarized and did not report the crimes. Cal Poly Public Safety Investigator Mike Kennedy said the situation is different on campus. “Most of our crime happens while students are still here,” Kennedy said. He said housing hires security guards that patrol the residence halls every night during the break. “We (Public Safety) also patrol housing. “It (burglary) is not a big problem during that time.” OfT campus, however, the burglary problem is serious, said Seybold. “It happens in major student housing complexes like Ramona Drive, Stenner Street, Foothill apartments and throughout the student housing community.” If at all possible, Seybold advises, “it is extremely important to take valuables with you. “If you must leave them behind, lock them up in a closet and at least write down the serial numbers. Take pictures of them, and engrave your driver’s license number in them. And then kiss it goodbye.” With a California driver’s license number engraved in it, the stolen item cannot be resold, he said. He also advised students to cover up anything that must be left in a car. Seybold called compact discs the “hottest item” and suggested owners write their license numbers across the front labels of CDs in a thick marker. Other valuables that students should not leave behind are compact disc players, stereos, bicycles, cassettes, car stereos, camera e-quipment and computers. “During this Christmas season, be real careful. There’s a lot of people out there who make their living ripping you off,” Seybold said.",
