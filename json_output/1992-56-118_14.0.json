    "article_text": "Whemver the perennial debate over capital punishment heats up, as it has again in California with the execution of Robert Alton Harris, I reach for my copy of Albert Camus’ classic 1957 essay “Reflections on the Guillotine,” published in the Nobel Prize-winning French author’s b<x)k “Resistance, Rebellion and Death.” Many firm believers in capital punishment have been converted into abolitionists after reading this essay. One argument by Camus should be particularly compelling for conservatives who support the death penalty yet oppose excessive government power. Camus reversed the conventional rationale for capital punishment as a defense of the social order against individual criminals. On the contrary, he asserted, in the Twentieth Century, “State crimes have been far more numerous than individual crimes...Hence our society must protect herself not so much against the individual as against the State.” According to Camus, the secular State has made itself into an absolute power, usurping God’s authority as Last Judge in believing it has the omniscience to determine who shall live and who shall die. Camus recognized that criminals too play God, but he believed capital punishment is an even more arrogant act because in it the State defies its own fallible legal processes. Shouldn’t those conservatives who are so quick to point out every flaw in governmental and judicial bureaucracies acknowledge the human flaws in that ultimate bureaucratic power, the death sentence? Judicial norms are not only error-prone but relative to different times and places. In 1960, Caryl Chessman was executed in California for kidnapping and rape, the Rosonbergs in 1953 for spying — neither of those sentences would be imposed today. Bribery is a capital offense in Communist countries — a policy that would decimate the population of America’s p>oliticjEil and business elite. A hundred years ago we hung cattle rustlers, so why not car thieves now? Those who cite the Bible as authority for the death penalty must believe, as indicated therein, that execution is warranted for witchcraft;, cursing one’s parent, adultery and premarital sex, or fatal attack by one’s ox. Thus this year’s norms for execution may change next year — too late for those already killed. And if we agree on grounds for the death penalty, should we implement it * with “humane” lethal injections like Texas or more “vengeful” means? If we believe ih the most harsh revenge, why not revert to boiling in oil or crucifixion — or more logically yet, keep the wotst criminals alive and torture them daily? Camus believed the death penalty is a blasphemy against Jesus Christ, who counseled those without guilt to cast the first stone and who himself was the victim of execution in “a staggering judicial error.” (Comedian Lenny Bruce mused that if Christ had lived in our time, Christians would henceforth wear miniature electric chairs on their necklaces.) What kind of model of Christian mercy were the demonstrators who stood outside San Quentin as Harris died, singing, “Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is?” Camus also argued that the State sets a negative example for its individual members in the acceptance of violence: “Bloodthirsty laws make bloodthirsty customs.” Camus presented evidence that increasing execu- tions and dealing more brutally with criminals in general serves less to deter the criminal mentality than tö incite its morbid and hostile impulses. The only way to break this vicious circle, Camus advised, is for government (over which we have the control we don’t have over individual criminals) to take the first steps toward de-escalating violence — advice taken by Frances Mitterand in abolishing the death penalty when he took office as president of PrEuice in 1981, with no subsequent increase in that country’s crime rate. In Camus’ analysis, we are all to some degree the product of our society; thus society bears some share of responsibility for breeding criminals. Most executed criminals — including Harris — have grown up in poverty and many have been abused as children. Alcohol and drugs frequently contribute to their crimes, yet those who profit from slum housing or selling criminals alcohol and drugs, as well as deadly weapons, are absoTved of any responsibility. Camus was not, however, a bleeding heart absolving the individual: “The instinct of preservation in societies, and hence of individuals, requires that individual responsibility be p>ostu-lated and accepted without dreaming of an absolute indulgence that would amount to the death of all society. But the same reasoning must lead us to conclude that there never exists any total responsibility.” His point was that even if society bears only one percent of the blame, by executing criminals rather than viewing the cost of life imprisonment as payment for its own share of blame, it absolves itself 100 percent. “Society proceeds sovereignty to eliminate the evil ones from her midst as if she were virtue itself. Like an honorable man killing his wayward son and remarking: ‘Really, I didn’t know what to do with him.’” For society’s self-protection, Camus advocated replacing capital punishment with life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for the most vicious criminals, and preventing their escape by isolating them on a Devil’s Island or Alcatraz. (He would also allow them the option of suicide, which makes more sense than when Utah authorities pumped Gary Gilmore’s stomach out of a self-induced overdose of pills in order to keep him alive for the firing squad.) Camus and abolitionists are not, as often charged, indifferent to victims and their survivors. Nothing can bring the victims back to life, but abolitionists suggest that the high costs of the legal process preceding execution, as well as the proceeds from imprisoned criminals’ labor. could be redirected toward compensating survivors. There are alternatives between execution and lax policies that permit release of dangerous criminals; certainly, opponents of the death penalty need to join with advocates in insisting in closing the outrageous loopholes that allow unregenerate killers to go free. As Camus concluded, “We know enough to say that this or that major criminal deserved hard labor for life. But we don’t know enough to decree' that he be shorn of his future...Forbidding a man’s execution would amount to proclaiming publicly that society and the State are not absolute values, that nothing authorizes them to legislate definitively or to bring about the irreparable.” Don Lazere is a professor of English at Cal Poly and author of The Unique Creation of Albert Camus, published by Yale University Press.",
