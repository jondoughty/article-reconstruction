The AAA affiliate said gasoline prices have been on the rise for the past four months, although prices today for unleaded at self-service pumps are 8 cents lower than a year ago. A CSAA survey of more than 600 service stations in Northern California and Nevada shows that prices of regular leaded at self-service pumps are averaging 88 cents a gallon this month, up 2 cents, with full-serve prices at $1.24, up 4 cents. Unleaded regular at full-service pumps is $1.22.",
