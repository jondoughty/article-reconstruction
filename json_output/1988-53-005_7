    "article_text": "Editor \u2014 Who is Dan Quayle? The uproar over his use of family influence to avoid military service in Vietnam is obscuring other defects in his background. Quayle's close friends and family acknowledge his glaring lack of intellectual ability. Theodore Bendall, Quayles\u2019s family attorney, recently said if he could change the Indiana senator he would \u201cincrease his I.Q. He is not an intellect.\u201d Quayle\u2019s father freely admits that his son\u2019s main interest in school was \u201cbroads and booze.\u201d Dan Quayle\u2019s mediocre academic standing in high school apparently prevented him from applying to major universities. Instead he went to little DePauw University where his grandfather was a member of the board of trustees and a major contributor. In college Quayle had a reputation for being a poor student, frequently drinking to excess, and dating many women. A former professor says Quayle received mostly C\u2019s and he got a D in at least one course in his major, political science. His good looks and nonintellectual image led some classmates to nickname him derisively as \u201cface man.\u201d Clark Adams, a former classmate, said \u201cHe was not a guy to take a position on anything except who his date was on Friday night and where to get drunk on Saturday night.\u201d Another classmate, Joseph Wirt, said Quayle majored in \u201cgirls, golf, and alcohol\u201d at DePauw. Quayle\u2019s college record was so spotty that a furor erupted in 1982 when the college announced it would award an honorary doctor of laws degree to Quayle. The faculty secretly voted 32-24 against awarding the degree. Despite Quayle\u2019s assertion that he joined the National Guard to go to law school as soon as possible, he did not go to law school right away. He did not meet Indiana University law school\u2019s academic requirements. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t take him in,\u201d his father, James Quayle, told the Washington Post. A year later, \u201csomehow he got in, he talked his way in\u201d and attended night school, James Quayle said. Quayle said he wanted to bypass the military because of his interest in law, but there is no evidence that he accomplished anything as an attorney. Quayle\u2019s friends in the legal profession cannot remember any cases that he handled. Almost immediately after opening his law practice, Quayle told his father he wanted to do something else and became assistant publisher of his father\u2019s newspaper. His grandfather, Eugene Pulliam, who headed the most powerful newspaper empire in Indiana, was famous for blatantly mixing right wing politics and newspaper journalism with impunity. Quayle\u2019s father was a member of the John Birch Society in the 1960s. The financial and editorial backing of his father got Quayle elected to the House in 1976. With the strong backing of his uncle\u2019s Indianapolis newspapers he became a U.S. senator in 1980. Voters have an opportunity to beat Bush and bag Quayle in November. Dan Quayle is another example of the intellectually bankrupt yuppie scum the country club Republicans are trying to foist on the American public as a poor excuse for leadership. The voters can see through their goody-two-shoes facade and trite cliches.",
