    "article_text": "Eklitor: Next Tuesday the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission begins what may well be the final hearings on whether Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant should be issu^ a low-power test license. How can the meml^s of the Cal Poly community who are opposed to the licensing effectively express their feelings? 1.\tSign the petitions circulating on campus and in town which call attention 'to the lack of emergency evacuation plans and emergency medical facilities for the area land, for that matter, as far as is known, for the campusl; 2.\tBe at a special rally next Monday night at the Mission from 7:30 to 8:30; 3.\tTake part in a march next Tuesday morning which will leave from the U.U. Plaza at 8:20 for the Discovery Inn where the hearings will be held (you will be able to be back on campus in time for your 9:30 classesl. Recently, the NRC has \"proposed regulations that would significantly reduce the public's right to gather information for use at licensing hearings.‚Äù The former Chair, Joseph Hendrie, has asked Congress to provide legislation to speed up the licensing process including \"permitting the MRC to authorize/fuelloading and low-power testing of nfw reactors before licensing hearings are completed.\" Within the past week the Administration has proposed a new chair for the conunission, thus attempting to fill a vacancy and allowing the entire commission to vote on all matters under its jurisdiction. Because of the qiecial conditions surrounding Diablo Canyon there will be national news coverage of the hearings and related events. A solid turnout is crucial to the success of the rally and the march. Your active inipport is needed now!\tRichaH Kranxdorf",
