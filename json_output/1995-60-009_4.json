Out of that With a new quarter beginning, stress and expectations for students are high, and so is the possibility of depression if the stress becomes too much and expectations are not met. But how do you know if your depression is bad enough that you need help? Peer Health Educators, along with workers from Health Services, Psychological Services, and the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), will be screening for depression from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday in the UU Plaza. The free screening is part of National Depression Screening Day (NDSD). Students, faculty and staff can take the anonymous 10 to 15 minute assessment tool — a series of questions to determine your emotional health — then go upstairs to UU 219 to go over their results. *At that time they can meet with a therapist or a Peer Health educator to review their test scores,” Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Coordinator Jean DeCosta explained. ”Those that need it are referred for follow-up counseling.” There will also be a presentation on depression, including a slide show and video, at 1 p.m. in UU219. NDSD began five years ago, but this is the first year Cal Poly has participated. Last year, 82,000 people attended screenings nationwide. *Cal Poly wants their students to be successful,” DeCosta said. ”This is one of the programs that ensiu'es that students will do well. *We know more about depression than ever before,” Def^osta continued. ”We can do more for depression as far as treatment, counseling and medical help. There’s a real movement to raise awareness. Depression is an illness, not a weakness. \\bu can’t snap out of it like a cold,” she continued. *With early detection though, you can do something about it. You don’t have to live with it.” EAP Specialist Bob Negranti, explained an interesting aspect of the screening day. It seems most programs are either just for students, or just for employees,” Negranti said. This program is for the entire campus population.” Student Affairs provides medical help, psychological help and counseling to students through Peer Health Education. Help for faculty and staff is available through EAP. The screening day lets everyone know that the resources to treat depression are available on campus,” Negranti said. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, over 17 million Americans are affected by depression each year, but only half actually receive treatment. Twice as many women suffer from depression than men. Some of the warning signs that someone may be depressed include: a significant change in appetite, sleep disturbances, fatigue and feelings of worthlessness. The major difference between just feeling down and having the blues has to do with the intensity and longevity of the sadness. When someone is depressed, it affects the entire body. The way in which they eat, sleep and think may change. DeCosta explained that even when something positive happens to someone, depression can strike. Sometimes when something good happens, like getting into Cal Poly, it can cause you to get depressed,” DeCosta said. Lots of freshman feel the loss of their parents and friends. Out of that good event, you can wind up getting depressed. Generally, depression runs in the family,” she continued. If parents or close family suffer from depression, then they may have a higher propensity to be depressed.” For anyone who does not feel comfortable taking the assessment test at the screening booth, an appointment can be made with counseling services for assessment and possible treatment of depression. There’s nothing to be ashamed of. You’re not ashamed when you have a common cold,” DeCosta said. Many times people feel bad about feeling depressed. So they wouldn’t treat themselves,” she said. If you have depression don’t be ashamed of it - we’ll try to get you the help you need.”",
