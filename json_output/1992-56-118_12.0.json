    "article_text": "After writing five books, three of which made the bestseller list, Arianna Stas-sinopoulos Huffington is helping her husband, Michael, with his Republican campaign for Congress. She spoke about her books and campaigning efforts during an interview Thursday. Huffington began her writing career when she studied at Cambridge after moving from her native city of Athens, Greece. She said she did not want to write, but was encouraged to do so after speaking on women’s rights in England. She completed her first book, “The Female Woman,” which she said was difficult because she was not confident in her writing. The book later became a best seller. “After that, I knew I would stay a writer,” Huffington said. The profession, which she said she eryoys, allows her to express her ideas. It is also a great way to organize her thinking. When working on a book, she said, “\\bu discover what you will say. It is a surprise. I never know how my book will come out until I am done,” she said. This was the case in her latest book, “Picasso: Creator and Destroyer,” which became a best seller and an international controversy. As her research continued she saw a man far from the world’s popular portrayal of Pablo Picasso. Huffington chose to write about Picasso because she felt he was a summing up of our century. His life and art represented some of the major battles of men and women, as well as man and God, she said. This was reflected in his work. “Writing about him is writing about our century. Every major battle is in his life and art,” she said. In addition to her writing, Huffington campaigns for her husband while speaking on cultural and political issues. When she is not speaking, she spends a great deal of time meeting with people and listening to their stories. She said she and her husband go wherever there are crisis points in the community, such as homeless shelters, children’s homes and transition homes. The campaigning does not wear her out. She said, “I love the heart connections you make. It matters how open you are with somebody so that connections happen right away.” However, when she needs a diversion from the negative aspects of the campaign, she spends time with her daughters, Isabella, 1, and Christina, 3. She also depends on God to give her the strength she needs. “There are so many ways to recharge myself,” she said. One of the most rewarding aspects of the campaign is getting Michael’s message across, she said. Michael feels that it is not constitutionally right to leave a $4 trillion debt to future generations. The Huffingtons are also receiving approval of their statement of the need to completely overhaul the American political system, she said. “The people who are part of the problem will not be part of the solution,” she said. The Huffingtons believe that reforms of Congress can be brought about by removing the old school and instituting term limits. She said there is a need for people who will stand for something even when it is unpopular. “True leadership is when one is ahead of the problem and one can go out and inspire people and convince them of what needs to be done,” she said. Huffington said her husband, Michael, recognizes the need for fundamental values that include building up the family unit and encouraging responsibility toward others. All levels of government, especially nationally, need to set priorities on education, she said. Recognizing the problems with education is to recognize the problems with the economy. Michael Huffington plans to reduce the deficit by revamping the country’s welfare system and making it into a transitional program, she said. That way people will not be able to make living off welfare a way of fife. She said people need to feel that they can take care of themselves.",
