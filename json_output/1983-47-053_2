    "article_text": "People Generating Energy and The Media Project present Bonnie Raitt and Jesse Colin Young in an acoustic performance at the Fremont Theatre at 7 pjn. on Sunday, Feb.6. Lights and sound for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Need Diablo\u00e2\u20ac\u009d concert will be powei^ entirely by the sun. Bonnie Raitt and Jesse Colin Young have actively supported People Generating Energy (P.G.E.) in their opposition to the Diablo Canyon \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnuclear power plant. The musicians are donating their time and energy to the benefit concert because they firmly believe nuclear power is intolerable and unnecessary. Their support over the past six years at rallies and concerts has helped P.G.E. promote alternative energies. Said Bonnie Raitt in an interview, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stopping nuclei power is not just another cause; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a necessity.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The performers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 musical talent and their strong conunitment to social justice and the environment has placed them among this decade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top recording artists. Bonnie Raitt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new band and her eighth album, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greenlight\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, have been greeted with much enthusiasm. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been trying to find a way to combine my musical career with interest in bringing about political change,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Raitt. Solar Genny One, a mobile electric generator which will provide lights and sound for the concert, was designed and built by Solarwest Electric in Santa Barbara. Genny One is owned and operated by two national solar advocacy groups, \u00e2\u20ac\u2122The Solar Lobby and the Center for Renewable Resources based in Santa Monica. The two groups sponsor The Media Project to educate people on how they can use solar energy and conservation. The unit generates all its electricity from sunlight. \u00e2\u20ac\u2122The electricity is stored in batteries and converted to AC power. Concert proceeds will be to continue educating and organizing the conununity on the dangers inherent in the use of nuclear power and the beneficial use of alternative energies. 'Tickets for the acoustic-solar concert are $11 and are on sale at Boo Boo Records, Cheap Thrills, Steve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bromeliads in Ba3rwood Park, and the People Generating Energy office at 452 Higuera St. For more information caU 543-8402 or 543-6614.",
