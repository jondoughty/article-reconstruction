    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Lot Anieles Dodgert, who won the National League West championship last year, and the San Diego Padres, who captured the division title in 1964, meet Monday in a 1986 season-opener at Do^er Sudhim. The game hu been a sellout since February. According to a Dodgers\u2019 spokesman, it\u2019s the earliest sellout in the club\u2019s history. Right-hander Eric Show, 12-11 last year, will start for the Padres against left-hander Fernando Valenzuela, 17-10 with a 2.45 earned run average for the Dodgers in 1985. After a slow start, the Dodgers rallied to win the NL West by 5 Vi games over Cincinnati in 1985. The Padres, meanwhile, started fast in an attempt to defend their title, but faded and finished in a tie for third place with Houston, 12 games back. The Dodgers were favorites to repeat as champions, but their situation changed drastically last Thursday during their final Florida exhibition game. Slugging Los Angeles out-Hekkr PeA'o Guerrero suffered a ruptured patella tendon below the left knee while sliding into third base in the first inning of a game against Atlanta and will be lost to the team for at least three months. ~ Guerrero was moved from third base to the outfield last June 1 and thrived on the switch immediately, hitting 15 home runs in the month of June. He finished the year with 33 homers and a .320 batting average. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible thing,\u2019\u2019 D^ers Manager Tom Lasorda said of Guerrero\u2019s injury. \u201cPedro means so much to our club. It\u2019s a tragic loss, but we still have a season to i^y. We\u2019ll fight and do the best we can without him.\u2019\u2019 Lasorda is beginning his 10th year at the Dodgers\u2019 helm. Meanwhile. San Di^o Manager Steve Boros will be managing his first game for the Padres. Boros was hired at the start of spring training, shortly after Dick Williams resigned as the Padres\u2019 msnigcr. Valenruela, 25, srill be making his fourth straight opening day start and his fifth in sbe years. Valenzuela, who signed a three-year, S5.5 million contract shortly before spring training, had a brilliant exhibition season, allowing only two earned runs in 31 innings while walking eight and striki^ out 27. He had identical performances in his last two outings, against Minnesota and Montr^, hurling seven shutout innings and allowing four hits while walking none and striking out six in each game. \u201cI hope for the same thing during the season,\u2019\u2019 Valenzuela said after blanking Montreal last Wednesday in his last start.",
