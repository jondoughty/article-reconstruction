    "article_text": "Editor \u2014 1 am writing to express my concern over certain aspects of the college atmosphere. There seems to be a serious lack of social dating at Cal Poly, and San Luis Obispo as well. At first, I figured this to be my problem, but it seems that many others have also come to address this issue. I have tried many times to ask girls out, and have always ended up with the same old excuses, along with suspicious eye contact as to the nature of the request. Last year, I took a psychology class and was informed by the professor and several members of the Gay and Lesbian Student Union that approximately 40 percent of the female population at Cal Poly is lesbian. That seemed rather high. 1 realized that other factors such as population ratios, academically stressful environment and location of the university also have to be taken into consideration. Still, the ballpark statistic stayed in the back of my mind. 1 am happy to say that this quarter I have been dating girls in Santa Barbara. There is an obvious difference in social attitudes. There is more openness there and less emphasis on deriving one\u2019s social life from a bottle of booze, as is the case here. In closing, 1 must say that my educational experience here has not been all negative. 1 have received a fast-paced education in SLO town! 1 also have a degree that says B.S. on it (and we all know what that stands for).",
