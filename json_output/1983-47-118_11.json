To an Henest, Cencemad Student; Why isn’t it tha reaponaibility of honest students to halp control cheating? If you are not willing to deal with tha problem, why do you foal others should have to deal with it? You claim that it is the “duty” of the instructors to deal with cheating. How can they effectively perform this “duty” if they get no help from the students? If you were walking down the street some evening and saw two robbers attacking a lady, what would you do? Would you ignore the situation because it is the “duty” of the police to deal with situations like this? I would sincerdy hops not. I hope you would have enough of a aanoa af naapnnsibflity as a dtisan of the eommanity to halp the ledr-WhUs 3TOU may argue that the two esses are unrelated, I claim they are similar. In both cases, someons is being hurt (tha lady directly vs. both you and the chsater himself indirectly). Phase, become a responsible citizen of the Cal Poly community. Don’t pasa the responsibility for controlling cheaters by claiming it h tha instructors’ duty. If everjrons would help daal with ths problem of cheaters, pretty soon ths problem would no longer exist.",
