    "article_text": "Six Cal Poly departments received almost S278,000 in grants from the National Science Foundation’s 1988 Instrumentation and Laboratory Program to fund equipment for various labs across campus. The program is in its fourth year. And Cal Poly has had an excellent record for the previous three, said Margaret Cardoza, director of grants development. Cal Poly had two grants in 1985, two in 1986 and three in 1987, totalling about S210,000. So, she said, getting six grants this year, totalling more than the three years before, was quite an accomplishment. Cal Poly’s President Warren Baker was reappointed last year to the NSF’s governing body, the National Science Board. The grants, ranging from $15,000 to $100,000, will help enormously in stretching Cal Poly’s equipment budget, said Cor-doza. They will provide matching funds for new equipment in these departments:\tindustrial engineering, biological sciences, natural resource management, metallurgical and materials engineering, electronic and electrical engineering and architecture.",
