Hailey said that the last few concerts have been held on Sunday and Monday nights when faculty would be using their offices. “It causes a special problem for coaches who work seven days a week during the season,” ha added.    Guidelines now state that the media door will be moved to the main entrance so as not to obstruct entry to the lobby of the gym. A security officer will be stationed at the media door as well. ^    Railey said he is still concerned about the entire building being shut down for a concert being held in one area of the building. “Students by the droves come in to workout on the weekends and dosing the building obstructs their right to use the building,” he said. No solution for that problem is stated in the guidelines.    Performers have also abused parts of the building, according to Railey. He said rooms used by the performers have smelled so strongly of marijuana that “instructors reported that they couldn't breathe.\"    As a result, the wrestling room will no longer be used as a snack bar and classrooms will no longer be used as dressing rooms for performers and concert workers. Instead, trailers or motor homes, when needed, will be moved to the back of the gym for dressing or rest areas for the performers, guidelines state.    Other guidelines deal with crowd control procedures. Because of police concern, concert-goers will not be allowed to line up for concerts until four hours before the performance. That lineup used to be able to start at 6 a.m. the morning of the concert, but Railey believes that encourages people to bring coolers and motivates them to “get bombed out and throw up during the concert.”    For crowd control procedures, guidelines state professional security groups will continue to be hired for large-scale concerts to help control concert-goers, prevent smoking, prevent disruptive behavior and pre-   vent illegal activity like the use of drugs, alcohol or ; any campus violation.     Other new procedures included in the list of guidelines refer to specific dean up duties to be completed by the Concert Committee after the concerts.     Morales said the Concert Committee has investigated alternative sites to hold a concert, but none is as good as the gym.     Chumash Auditorium has been cancelled out as a possible site for two reasons, said Morales. The auditorium is small, so the performers would have to stage two shows in order for the Concert Committee to break even. Morales also thinks there is not enough in-treet in small groups at a concert.     The second reason, said Morales, is the weak floor. No dances can be held in the auditorium because of the floor, and many of the concerts encourage dancing.     Morales said the committee has considered holding another concert in the University Union Plaza like it did last year with the Plimsoula and Kingbees. If permission is granted for an outdoor concert, Morales . thinks the concert could be controlled and planned in such a way that it would end early.     Several nearby residents, including President Warren Baker, complained of the noise from the concert last year. \"I still hope in the future we can have another outdoor concert.” said Morales, “maybe in Poly Grove.”     The Concert Committee even checked alternative sites off campus such as the Cuesta College gym, but problems exist with that solution also, said Morales.     Both gyms on Cuesta College campus seat 1,600 lees people than the Cal Poly gym, he said, adding it is also difficult to get the buildings for ues.     “We missed out on holding a Madness concert on March 2 because of paper work,\" said Morales. According to him, the Concert Committee asked to use one of the gyms at Cuesta. Cuesta officials were hesitant because the gyms are rarely rented out for outside use, but they made an exception and granted it.    On a cold, windy Saturday afternoon, the Cal Poly women’s swim team finished their dual medt season undefeated, drowning the University of Pacific, 64-41.    Senior All-American Ann Stier led the Mustangs with three victories. two of which qualified her for the nationals to be held in New York on March 7. Stier broke the Imutmt in the 600 free (5:06.35) and the 400 individual medley (4:44.29). She also won' the 100 fly with a tine of 1*1.90.    “Ann had pome good swims,” said coach Duane McRoy. “She gutted out the 500 for a great'time.”    Teammate Anne Gatlin, who has aheady qualified for nationals in three events and two relays, won the 100 back with a time of 1:04.42, and broke the 39- second barrier in the 50 back (29.65) in an exhibition swim.    Other individual winners for the Mustangs included: JoanMary Laubacher, 50 free (25.79): Susan Watt, 100 free (56.19): Nancy Stem, 200 Breast (2:33.50): and Jennifer Shofiekl, 200 free (2:12.89).    In diving, Donna McRoy fought off the bad weather to qualify for nationals on the one-meter board with a total of 363 points.    With nationals less than a month away, the Mustangs already have eight girls qualified to compete in a total of 18 events.    The Mustangs have also attained standards in the 400 medley relays and 800 free relays, but their 200 free, and 200 medley relays have yet to qualify. The last chance to make the trip to New York will be in two weeks in a meet to be held in the USC Olympic pool.  There is no greater joy than to have a healthy, beautiful baby.
