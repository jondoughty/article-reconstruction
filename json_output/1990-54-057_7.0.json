    "article_text": "As a youngster, Jack Algeo lived on a cattle ranch in eastern San Diego. Today, Jack Algeo is the head of the animal science and industry department at Cal Poly. \"It’s interesting to come back to the university after having years of experience in the industry under your belt,” Algeo said. ‘Tve spent most of my working life in the industry (animal science) doing work in 11 western states,” he said. Algeo’s first job was teaching animal science and nutrition at Cal Poly in 1949. Algeo graduated from Washington State with a master’s degree in Animal Science Nutrition and a bachelor’s degree in Animal Science. Before returning to Cal Poly about four years ago, Algeo worked in the animal science industry in many capacities. He worked as a resident nutritionist for a Santa Maria company, where he was responsible for livestock nutrition and research. He said people in this company were innovators in the mechanized feeding of livestock. From there he opened his own consulting firm working as an animal scientist in nutrition. Algeo then decided to sell his firm and return to Cal Poly after taking “a 30-year sabbatical.” Algeo said the animal science and industry department at Cal Poly is unequaled by any in the country. “Cal Poly and our system is absolutely the best for undegraduate training,” he said. “The Cal Poly Foundation makes the system go.” Algeo is also working on the Beef Safety Assurance Task Force. This task force, which has representatives throughout the United States, is a means to assuring that store owners and consumers have safe and wholesome beef products. Algeo said the animal science industry has been a mature and stable industry. “You will see better products on the market that are consumer oriented — a product that’s as safe as humans can make it,” he said. Algeo said one of the most important things in the industry in years is to breed a leaner animal. “We produce a leaner, more healthier product than we have ever before,” Algeo said. “Today, there’s 2 to 7 percent fat content within a loin steak. In years past there’s been 20 to 25 percent fat content. There’s a push to produce a nutritionally dense product that’s high in vitamins, iron and protein.” Throughout his travels across the United States, Algeo has noticed that the one big question the consumer asks him is,“How come you use hormones and antibiotics in cattle?” Algeo said people are misinformed when told that the hormone estrogen could cause cancer. Estrogen production in the human male is 130,000 parts per billion (ppb) daily, said Algeo. In the nonpregnant female it’s from 200,000 to 1 million ppb’s daily. A steak from a non-implanted animal is about 2.4 ppb, and 3.2 for an implanted animal. “How can it be any big thing when a steer has only 3.2 ppb?” he said. “There’s a lot of false information on this. It is safe.” He said that less than 5 percent of beef producers are feeding antibiotics to their cattle. “There’s more effective ways than feeding antibiotics to cattle,” Algeo said. Antibiotics are used mainly when animals are sick, he said, adding that antibiotics are used to keep the animal alive. In addition, it costs too much to always feed the animals antibiotics. Algeo said the industry tries hard to meet stringent FDA and USDA standards. Algeo said he’s enjoyed working at Cal Poly and in the industry. “I tell my students to do something they like to do,” he said. “When you do something you like to do, you invariably do it well.”",
