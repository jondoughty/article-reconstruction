    "article_text": "Students eating habits cause many problems for the library, the director of the Robert E. Kennedy Library said. David Walch said crumbs left by snacking students attract silverfish: small wingless insects. If students mix food into books while studying, silverfish may move into the books and generate, he said. This requires expensive fumigation to correct. Libraries take many steps to preserve their collections such as a controlled climate. Walch said food mixed in with books multiplies the problem of deterioration. Library furniture also falls victim to student dining. Students often spill coffee and other drinks on the couches and carpet in the library, Walch said. He said students also stick chewing gum under table tops and in cracks between couch cushions. Students eating while studying abuse library books outside of the library as well. Walch said the worst case of food stains he has seen at Cal Poly was a book which had been returned laced with ketchup. Students have gone far in breaking library rules against consuming food there. One student ordered a pizza and had it delivered to the library, he said. — Walch said students tend to eat in the library more in the evening, but eating starts in the morning with cups of coffee brought into the building. Students can solve the problems of food damage to library facilities best by doing their eating outside of the library, Walch said. Students caught eating in the library will be asked to finish their food outside or to throw it away, he said. \"Fortunately I’ve never encountered a student who did not cooperate when confronted with the problem,\" Walch said. \"If there was an attitude of belligerence, we would call security. The size of the library makes food control difficult, Walch added. With five stories and 2,300 student study spots, a full-time employee would be needed to police the library, he said. Walch said the library staff tries to catch people with food as they enter the library, but with an average of 5,000 students entering each day, stopping the majority of violators is doubtful. Walch said he would welcome a student volunteer group to help supervise but has not planned such a group as of yet.",
