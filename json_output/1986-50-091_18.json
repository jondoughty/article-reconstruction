    "article_text": "The Director of Business Affairs for Cal Poly had his tide changed to Vice President for Businas Affairs April 1 as part of President Warren J. Baker’s restructuring of his suff. . Jim Landreth. who held the position for almost 15 years, will ■i. have the same job duties. He has five distinctive areas .of responsibility which include campus fiscal operations, budget planning and administration, planning and support services, public safety and the business and plant operations functions of housing and conference services. “I am pleased that the presi-I ^ dent has seen fit to changf; my title,” said Landreth, who has ~ been working at the Cal Polys, here and in Pomona, for almost 30 years. In a memorandum to his top staff members, Baker wrote: \"With the title change for Landreth, I note the restructufing of the administration of the university and I also recognize the exemplary job that (he) has done in a vital role.” There will now be four vice presidents directly accounUble to Baker: the vice president for academic affairs, who will also act as senior vice president, the vice president for information systenu, the vice president for university relations and Lan-dreth’s position. The vice president for academic affairs is a title change for the provost position. Provost Tomilson Fort will leave his position on July 1, and an interim vice president for academic affairs will take over on that date. Landreth said they hope to initiate recruitment for that position soon. A permanent vice présidait for academic ^ affairs is expected to be appointed by Jan. 1. The position of vice president for information systems is new to Cal Poly. That person will be in charge of administrative and instructional services for communication on campus, including data base management, information systems planning, university computer systems and telecommunications. Baker formed a committee to choose the vice president for information systems; Landreth is on the 13-member committee. He was also named to the 14-member task force to search for solutions to the problems of funding athletic scholarships. James Strom has been the vice president for university relations for almost 2 years. According to Howard West, associate executive vice president, Landreth’s title change came about because of the resignation of Provost Tomlinson Fort, the recommendation that a vice president for information systems be established and that the chief provost title will be changed. “With those issues at hand, it probably seemed an appropriate time to recognize the function that Landreth has been performing all of this time,” West said. LandrOh said his title change, along with the restructuring of Baker’s suff, was prompted by a new CSU system policy. “It’s now a trend in the CSU for people in my position and with my responsibUities to have this title.” The CSU system was structured for years by a unique policy that only allowed for two vice presidents per university. Traditionally there was always a vice president of academic affairs, said Landreth. About two years ago the CSU implemented a nunagement personnel plan as a byproduct of collective bargaining., Those persons that held madagemem or supervisory level positions were exempt from collective bargaining. With the new^ policy, presidents were given more flexibility to change job titles and assignments. “The real impact occurred at the vice president level,” said Landreth. Three other administrators work under the general direction of Baker, and won’t have title changes: Jan Pieper, director of personnel and employee relations; Russ Brown, dean of stu-denu; and Douglas Ocrard, executive dean of facilities administration.",
