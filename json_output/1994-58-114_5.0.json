    "article_text": "On the quiet street of Balboa near Laguna Lake, Cal Poly students live next to a retired couple. But the two households’ occupants don’t like each other much, and Alvin and Norma Rogers say that’s because the students lack basic respect. Two blocks over, on Coral Court, a similar living arrangement exists. But Ed and Gladys Fraund say their student neighbors are considerate. The two stories are on opposite sides of a spectrum of student-neighbor relations in San Luis Obispo that ranges from civility to outright enmity. Many Cal Poly students live in homes in residential areas because they like the freedom from the rules that go along with dorm and apartment living. Usually, students can live harmoniously with the families in their neighborhood. But sometimes things go wrong. Some say this is because many students don’t realize that living in a home has its limitations too. The Laguna Lake area is a neighborhood that only in recent years has acquired many student residents. With the influx, it has become a cross-section of San Luis Obispo, characterizing the gamut of neighborhoods’ attitudes toward students and the students’ own attitudes toward neighborhoods. Alvin and Norma Rogers have lived in their family home on Balboa for nearly 30 years. Everything was fine until about five years ago when a Cal Poly student’s parents from the Bay Area purchased the home next door for their son to rent with his friends. At first the students living next door weren’t a problem. Then, the owners’ son moved out. Since then, it has been a matter of luck from quarter to quarter. The couple feels “most students are good, self-respecting people” and that they have had “some neat students next door.” But a few bad experiences, including their current situation, have made them averse to having students as neighbors. They said they have had problems with parties, noise, garbage, parking, unkempt yards, loud motorcycles and lights kept on all night. “If Cal Poly students continue to move into this area, we’ll be forced to move out,” said Norma Rogers. “And we don’t think that’s fair.” The two don’t entirely blame students for their situation, though. “It’s a combination of factors,” said Alvin Rogers. “It’s not just the students, it’s the out-of-town landlords. And the city, too.” The couple said if landlords cared about their property as more than just revenue, maybe their tenants would respect the property, too. They also said that the city should require landlords to maintain their rentals’ yards to avoid property devaluation. Much of the Rogers’ problem with students is that they don’t keep up their lawn. “The (grass) was four-feet high (recently),” said Norma Rogers. Their neighbors. Cal Poly students Randy Schultz, Gail Weaver, Buck Chow and Jason Curtis, agree:\tSince their landlord doesn’t care about the look of the property, they don’t either. “We can see where (our neigh- bors) are coming from,” Curtis said. “Since we don’t own the house, we have a different mentality (about caring for it).\" “The yard is our responsibility,” Schultz said. “But we didn’t have $200 to $300 for a lawnmower. And the one the landlord provided doesn’t work.” Last month, they borrowed some weed-eaters from friends and mowed the lawn. “We like it short, too, “ Curtis said. The students said they don’t dislike Alvin and Norma Rogers. “But we feel we were already on their s-----list before we intro- duced ourselves,” Weaver said. “I wanted to make a good relationship with our neighbors, but I feel that there’s no way we’ll ever win because we’re students.” Chow agreed. “If they would have asked us nicely instead of saying, ‘Hey, you’re students, and we know you don’t think about things,’ maybe we would try harder,” Chow said. But the Rogers feel they are reasonable because they didn’t approach the students with their concerns until there was a problem. Alvin and Norma Rogers feel that it’s the city’s responsibility to pass ordinances and enforce them. “The students need to made aware of the laws, too,” Norma Rogers said. “Maybe the city could publish handbooks for people living in single-family dwellings” which outline guidelines for cooperative and legal living, she said. Residents for Quality Neighborhoods has often lobbied the City Council to implement various restrictions in San Luis Obispo neighborhoods, often successfully. Its projects have ranged from overnight parking ordinances to restricting the number of people allowed to share a dwelling. “The people in RQN are not against students.” said RQN Co-Chair Tom Kay. “They’re against having their rights infringed upon.” He said the group realizes it’s a small percentage of the students that reinforce negative stereotypes of all the others. Kay said he thinks Week of Welcome is a good time to give guidelines to new students about how to be good neighbors. “Maybe we could have a speaker come and discuss what’s acceptable behavior away from home,” he said. A better understoncfitig Not all situations where students live next door to family residences are unpleasant. 'Two blocks over from Balboa, on Coral Court, Ed and Gladys Fraund live next door to Cal Poly students Melissa Nelson, Jenna Thompson, Cathy Bandy and Stephanie Boda. The students also have two dogs, a cat and a bunny. The students said they feel they have a good relationship with their neighbors because they try hard to be considerate. 'The students said that the previous renters were problematic, and their landlord was rather skeptical about renting to students because of past disasters. “They even tried to sell the house because they'didn’t want to rent to students,” Thompson said. But the Fraunds showed them the house for the owner and took a chance. “We’ve had no problems whatsoever with our neighbors,” Nelson said, “because we try to be courteous.” “We are polite and don’t have huge parties. (The Fraunds) don’t mind as long as we don’t wake them up.” The students said they get along with the Fraunds so well that they have fed their dogs and parked a car in their driveway when no one was home. The Fraunds agp-eed that the students next door are considerate. “But then, we don’t go looking for trouble,” said Gladys Fraund. “The girls next door are very nice,” she said. “We don’t even know they’re there usuallv.” “You only hear about the bad kids, not the good ones,” said Ed Fraund. “On the whole, (students) have been in and out of the area for 10 to 12 years, and about 90 percent of them were fine.” The Fraunds said when they have had problems with student neighbors, it was usually because of parties, noise and parked cars which filled the cul-de-sac so they couldn’t get out. “If the students and the people in the neighborhood talk with each other, usually they can work things out,” said Ed Fraund. “When students move in, we introduce ourselves.” The Fraunds agreed with Norma and Alvin Rogers that responsibility does not lie entirely with the students. “The landlords or real estate people ought to take care of the yard maintenance. I don’t mind lending my mower and rakes and things to the students, but they should really take care of that for them,” Ed Fraund said. “I think students and residents can work together (living in the same neighborhood),” he added. “But you have to have consideration for each other.”",
