    "article_text": "The Cal Poly swim teams ran into some stiff competition Saturday, as they lost to Cal State Northridge in their second conference meet of the season. The loss drops both the men’s and women’s conference records to 1-1 after they each started the season with wins over Cal State Los Angeles on Jan. 17. Freshman backstroke swimmer Amy Holland turned in the Mustangs’ most impressive performance Saturday by beating defending national champion Stacy Mettam in the 200-yard backstroke en route to qualifying for nationals. Holland turned in a time of 2:10.71, which is just over a second faster than the national qualifying time. Also recording first place finishes for the women were Nancy Stern, who won the 200-yard breast stroke, Linda Tucker, who took first in the 200-yard butterfly and Liz Linton, who captured the 1,000-yard freestyle. Despite their several strong, individual performances, the Mustang women were done in by the depth of the Northridge freestylers. “We won all the stroke events and the distances, but they took all the freestyles,” said coach Bob Madrigal. “You just can’t give that up and expect to win.” The Northridge women placed strong in the 50, 100 and 200-yard freestyle events to help them to the win. In the men’s competition, junior Neil Leary won the 200-yard butterfly for the only first place finish for the men.",
