    "article_text": "Covin condemned Jerry Falwell, Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker as examples of the kinds of men who perpetrate meanness, bigotry or pettiness. King believed Christianity meant loving your neighbor. ‘‘He used his religion,” Covin said. ‘‘But instead of the way others have used it for meanness and pettiness he used it for a broader vision of humanity and justice.” Covin said he wanted to help establish the manner in which King’s birthday is celebrated. ‘‘I think the first several years of observation will set the precedent for how this holiday is to be observed,” Covin said. ‘‘This could be a time of superficialities and banalities. ‘‘This could become a time of pointless memorial marches. It could become a time of sales in retail stores. It could become a time of hearing the same speeches and seeing the same videotapes and films over and over again. I hope it becomes Covin said the celebration should be a reflective time, for examining the treatment of blacks in this country. ‘‘In 1963 black people talked about ‘freedom now!’ — they talked about it because they did not feel free,” Covin said. ‘‘They were imprisoned by a system of laws and institutions which specifically and explicitly imposed a position of inferiority on them.” Covin said that in the South his life could be taken from him for no reason. He related an experience he had in 1964 when he was working with a racially integrated group in the South. They had stopped for lunch at a restaurant for blacks, the only place a racially mixed group could eat together. ‘‘By the time I got ready to sit down all the tables were full,” Covin said. ‘‘I was the only one in my group without a seat so I went to the counter. The man I sat’ next to looked at me then he looked back at the group I was in. Then he looked back at me awhile and said ‘do you know where you is?’ I nodded and said ‘Ido.’ ‘‘He looked at me awhile longer then he said, ‘Yeah, well, you in Mississippi — you and me they doesn’t think much of us here, they just as soon kill you as look at you.’ He asked me if I understood. He was trying to save my life.” Covin said another time, while he was working for the civil rights movement in Alabama in the 60s, that a white minister had to sneak on and off the campus of a black college. ‘‘He came to speak to us ... if any white people had known, that would have been the end of his ministry and it might have been the end of his life,” Covin said. ‘‘That was not freedom for anyone — black or white.” Covin said that many critics of the civil rights movement have said it lacked a focus. “It is not true that the goals of the civil rights movement were vague,” he said. “The goals were so obvious and so clear they didn’t have to be defined. When people said they wanted freedom, any fool could see what they meant.” Blacks wanted a say in the government, freedom from routine assaults, freedom from harassment and freedom to eat inside of restaurants instead of having to use the take-out window because it was illegal to go inside. Covin said. In short, freedom meant to be treated like human beings. “They wanted futures for their children which were not demeaning and degrading,” Covin said. “Freedom. Freedom from those horrible, monstrous, terrifying and oppressive conditions. Freedom — the end of that madness.”",
