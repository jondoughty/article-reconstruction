    "article_text": "Our Baker Who art on campus (once in a while) Hallowed be thy name (at least to your subordinates and the ignorant in the Student Senate) Thy kingdom is here (but where are you?) Thy will be done (if not rightfully, forcefully) On campus As well as in Washington, D.C. (where is your heart, Mr. President?) Take from us our daily bread (and give it to the jocks) And forgive us our bitching (because the blissfully ignorant model students do not bitch) As we forgive the jocks (who bitch about lack of support) In the name of President Baker His Id, and his Superego AMEN Postscript: Mr. President, do you dream that someday they will name a great, big building on campus after you? Maybe it will be a huge 2,(X)0-man sauna for all the jocks that will be enrolled at Cal Poly. They’ll call it THE BAKERY. It’H be a monument of irony in honor of the Civil Engineer/Cal Poly President who bowed to support the jocks with a building realized through engineering techniques (knock knock, remember engineering? — once the essence of academics at Cal Poly).",
