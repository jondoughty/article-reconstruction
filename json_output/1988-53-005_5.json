If a permanent building location for a homeless shelter is not found by Oct. 31, the Salvation Army announced that it will fold the umbrella it has held over the San Luis Obispo homeless since Feb. I. The Salvation Army has been providing a small van to transport the homeless from City Hall to its shelter on Kansas Avenue. The shelter has an open fire and grill to heat canned foods, two 6B-by-2(>-foot open trailers and 20 cots with blankets for overnight lodging. Without refrigeration, storage and washing facilities, the Salvation Army says it feels its efforts to provide humane protectorship have been crippled. Of the two trailers provided, only one has electricity, said Site Director Jennifer Abbott, emphasizing that exposed electrical wires in the one trailer endanger nighttime users. Leaks in both trailers also cause the growth of mold and mildew, she said. Abbott said the shelter would close if thoroughly inspected by health officials. Captain Dan Hughes of the Salvation Army told Coun-cilmembers that because the health and safety of the program coordinators is at risk, he feels it is time to find a more permanent facility. San Luis Obispo Coalition for the Homeless Chairman George Moylan said the community must find something workable that will continue to be sup- “Any proposal in any zone does not specifically allow for a shelter ... but this leaves an opening for legal problems,” he said. Moylan pointed out that there are only three options in dealing with the homeless iuiie. “These people can either be eliminated, institutionalized or sheltered,” Moylan said. “The first went out with Hitler, the second is more than society is willing to pay and the third is one way of inexpensively confronting the problem.” The homeless coalition includes representatives from the Economic Opportunity Council, Women’s and People’s Shelter, Red Cross, city and county officials and other non-profit organizations within the county. From November 1987 to June 1988, the city provided the Salvation Army with $17,172. An additional $18,000, only 14 percent of the Salvation Army’s budget, will be given by the end of 1988. The county gave the Salvation Army $45,000 from November 1987 through June 1988 and will finish the year with another $39,750 allotment. Abbott said the funding is approximately one quarter of what they need to provide a quality shelter and staff to handle the number of homeless. Councilmembers have received complaints from parents that their children are being frightened by the irrational behavior of the homeless. Reports of homeless people defecating on private property also angered Mayor Ron Dunin. Dunin repremanded the Salvation Army, telling them to supervise their clients more thoroughly so they would not disrupt the lives of residents. Dunin also threatened to stop city support of the program. “The population of San Luis Obipso is becoming hostage to this small group of people,” Dunin told Salvation ficials. Director Toni Flynn responded by saying that the Salvation Army cannot monitor the behavior of the homeless after they leave their pick up site, shelter and drop off location. \"We’re doing the best we can, but we can’t follow them around all day. They are citizens and we have no authority to tell them what they can and cannot do,” said Flynn. Councilmembers last week concluded.

'\"It Doesn't Have to he Fattening to he fantastic!\" The results of a study on bulimia published in the Sept. 15 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine will not affect the treatment of bulimia victims at Cal Poly, said a mental health nurse at the Cal Poly Health Center. The study, conducted by Drs. Rodger Liddle and Thomas Geracioti Jr. concluded that there is an association between women suffering from bulimia and a gastrointestinal hormone which induces a feeling of fullness. “What we have at this point is an association where bulimics have low levels of a hormone,” Liddle said in a telephone interview. “It’s the first indication that there may be a hormonal abnormality involved. Bulimia is certainly a very complicated il- Bulimia, an eating disorder characterized by uncontrollable binge eating, is estimated to affect one in 10 to one in six college women ages 18 to 24. In the study, 14 bulimics were compared to a 10-member control group. Those suffering from bulimia were found to have lower levels of the hormone cholecystokinin than those in the control group. Rita Rich, mental health nurse at the Cal Poly Health Center, said she feels that although the study’s conclusion is based on legitimate facts, it is generally inconclusive at this time due to the limited number of people tested. “I think that it is probably something we need to continue to look at,” Rich said. The study also found that antidepressant treatment helped some bulimics and raised their levels of the hormone. “There are a number of women who are depressed as well as bulimic, but that isn’t true with all of them,” Rich said. Rich said she feels that factors in the cause of the disease can be sociological as well as psychological and are frequently related to poor self-esteem. The treatment of bulimic students at Cal Poly includes nutritional assessment and planning, a physical exam, individual counseling, group counseling and in some cases, antidepressants. Liddle said there are still many unanswered questions as to why the hormone level was low to begin with and why it improved with antidepressants. “We need to look at a larger number of patients ... at other treatments ... at patients with other types of eating disorders,” Liddle said.

But i3)w workers at City Hall are ^mplaining about the loitering fad use of bathroom facilities. jCity officials continue to jscuss possible solutions to the ])meless problem. The problems are said to continue regardless of the pick up and drop off location. The problem is not lack of money or too few volunteers. The problem is locating an acceptable shelter for the homeless. Salvation Army representatives said they feel that their requests for property are rejected because no one wants the homeless next door. Help create the first 21st century company.
