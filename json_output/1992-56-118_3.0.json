    "article_text": "President Warren Baker delivered promising news to the engineering technology faculty members after touring their department Friday. In a private meeting with the faculty, Baker told them that every student in the department will graduate with an ET degree, according to Department Head Kim Davis. They were also told that no tenured or tenure-track faculty will be laid off for fall quarter. Baker did not say what will happen after then. “The question still remains who would teach the ET courses if the faculty aren’t around after fall,” Davis said. However, he was pleased with the news. “We’ve gained a major breakthrough from Baker.” The ET students agreed, although they still plan to continue protesting the proposed phaseout. “We’re on (to continue protesting) for Monday,” said John Luna, president of the American Society of Engineering Technologists. “The decision is not over yet.” During the meeting, Davis presented Baker with some alternatives to cutting the ET curriculum. He suggested moving ET programs, including all students and faculty, into complementary engineering departments. Davis said that Baker “just glanced at the proposal,” but he said he would look it over in depth later. “There is no question of the value of our department,” Davis said. “Baker does see technology and engineering working together.” The faculty members said that Baker seemed impressed with the students during the tour. “He stressed it over and over,” professor Fred Friedman said. “They really did a fantastic job.” During the hourlong tour, students showed lab work, typical homework assignments and senior projects. Baker listened intently and asked questions throughout the tour. The presentations emphasized the correlation between the course work and the work graduates do in the industry. One example is the microwave technology loeing taught. It exposes students to the practical hardware seen in the industry, professor Neill Clark said. Clark worked at Hewlett Packard for several years before coming to Cal Poly. His connections enable the department to acquire valuable equipment for the students’ practical education, said Kevin Wright, an ET senior. One of the senior projects Baker saw was done by the Society of Automotive Engineers. Of the group’s seven members, three are ET majors. The group designed and built a vehicle that may revolutionize the stability of a car, Vince Ter-zian, an ET senior told Baker. It is being tested on the General Motors test track, Terzian said. “Without the ET majors, this vehicle would not have been able to be produced,” Terzian said. Wright called engineering technology “the handshake between theory and production.” He said that ET graduates-have the engineering education to understand the designs, and with their technology background, they also know if the idea can actually be produced. At the end of the tour, Michael Cruz, an ET senior, presented Baker with a petition to save the department. It was signed by 5,479 Cal Poly students and faculty members. It was also signed by an additional 61 Cuesta College faculty and staff members. “Of the 500 students I personally talked to, maybe 12 wouldn’t sign the petition for whatever reason,” Cruz said before the tour. “I think that it is important that Baker, Koob and Lee realize that students are willing to skim from their departments to help out others,” he said.",
