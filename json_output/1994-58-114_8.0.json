    "article_text": ".Rejection. It can be devastating. It hurts. I was trying to become a Residential Adviser for next year and went through the recruitment process a little while ago. There were approximately 125 applicants, and after each day of the recruitment weekend, about 35 were cut. I made it through the first two cuts, which allowed me to come back to each of the recruitment days. During those days all applicants went through a series of tests geared towards screening. The tests were elaborate role playing games that sometimes called for team work and other times called for individualism. Unfortunately, I received notice that I wasn’t among those chosen for the position next year. At first I was upset and a bit irate. I thought I had wasted my precious time going through stupid role playing games and made a fool of myself in the process by yelling, “It’s a great day to be an R.A.!” Each of the days started at 8:30 a.m. and lasted until about 5 p.m. — a time that I could have spent more wisely by doing homework or at least sleeping in. I even missed my first intramural softball game! OK — it was rained out, but that’s not the point. There were many other productive things that 1 could have been doing during that weekend. But then I remembered the fun I really had during the process. I met a lot of wonderful people and made some new friends. Who knows, some of them might be my R.A.S next year! I even learned something that will last throughout my lifetime. You see, I am naive. I’m sure after reading this you will agree. I’m not used to big city life, as I come from a small conservative valley just south of here. For example. Cal Poly’s student population is around 15,000; my valley is composed of five towns with a combined population of approximately 13,000. Also, this is my first year here and I live in one of the red brick halls. There are about 200 students living in my residence hall; my graduating class from the only high school in the valley was 180. I hope you get the point. Living in such a small valley has sheltered me from diversity. I could probably go through my high school yearbook and count the number of Asians and African Americans on my fingers and toes. However, dealing with people from diverse ethnic backgrounds has never been a problem for me. I have no prejudices towards skin color. I believe we are all the same inside, it’s just the outside that looks a little different. I’m afraid that when I say this, though, I am being hypocritical. It seems that I only relate this to ethnic backgrounds, yet there is much more to people than the color of their skin. Along with not knowing very many people of color, my small town sheltered me from homosexuals. I think I knew only two male couples living in my town, 'They were all very nice and acted nothing like any of the stereotypes. I don’t think I ever thought of them as “gay.” To me they were just friends of my parents who might wave to me on the street. These couples were much older than I, the youngest was in his early forties. I believe this is the main reason I had no problems with any of them. Also, the fact that they were men helped. I have never known a woman that was homosexual, nor have I known any homosexuals my age. I used to think homosexuality was disgusting and bad because it isn’t the “norm.” I also would be scared to be around a gay woman because I thought she might try to hit on me. I am afraid that both of these reactions stem from ideas planted in my head by stereotypes. However, my eyes were opened during the R.A. recruitment process. Each of the two days I was assigned to a group of ten applicants like myself. We had to cooperate with and trust each other to accomplish the tasks set forth by the facilitators (current R.A.’s and other Residential Life and Education department heads). During some of the activities personal views came out causing tension, but my group worked around them well. For instance: One exercise that turned out to be very emotional was a simulation of a world without freedom during which some of the members religious beliefs and sexual preferences came out. I was surprised to find out some of the people in my group (my teammates) were homosexual. I felt a little strange and a bit nervous around those people after learning this. Then I thought about what we had accomplished during the weekend, how we had become friends through it all, and I realized that someone’s sexual preference, skin color or religion made no difference. So I guess I was being too harsh when I said I wasted my time with the recruitment weekend. Actually, it was very exciting for me — not only did I have fun meeting people from all walks of life, but I grew a little more through the process. I learned that we are all equal — it’s not just a saying. Not only does skin color not matter, but religion and sexual preference don’t either. Because, when it comes down to it, everyone can work together to accomplish even the craziest of tasks. As I thought about it more, I realized my rejection wasn’t the end of the world. I hope that the other applicants that weren’t selected feel the same. As they say, “When the Lord closes a door, somewhere he opens a window.” I can’t wait to see where it is!",
