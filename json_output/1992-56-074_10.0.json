    "article_text": "A new generation of food additives is now appearing on American market shelves — fat substitutes. They were developed by the food industry in response to public concern about fat, cholesterol and calories in our diets. However, many people are wondering whether fat substitutes are a dieter’s dream, or just another marketing gimmick. It is important to realize that we do need some fat in our diet. Unfortunately, the average American eats much more fat than the body needs. The excess fat we eat contributes to health dangers such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Tb help avoid these problems, many health experts recommend that we reduce or fat intake from our average 37 percent of calories down to 30 percent or less. Fat substitutes in a variety See NUTRITION, page 6 of products may help us achieve this goal, without givdng up many of our favorite fix)ds. Recently, two main catagories of fat replacements have been developed — calorie-free fat substitutes and calorie-reduced fat substitutes. Calorie-free fat substitutes such as Olestra, a Proctor & Gamble product, are formulas made primarily from fat and a small amount of sugar. Olestra has a che.nical structure which passes through our digestive system without being absorbed, so it yields no calories. While calorie-free fat substitutes have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, they have great potential for use in foods. According to the March 1991 issue of Diabetes Forecast, a servdng of fast-food French fries now contains about 16 grams of fat and 230 calories. If fried in 75 percent Olestra, instead of pure vegetable oil, it would have only 4 grams of fat and 210 calories. One calorie-reduced fat substitute that is currently approved and on the market is Simplesse, from the NutraSweet Company. It is a “natural” product made from milk and/or egg white protein, in a process called microparticulation. The mixture is heated and blended to form tiny bubbles of protein which have the creamy, rich texture of fat, Thday Simplesse can be found in some frozen desserts, and it is awaiting approval for use in a variety of other foods. Simplesse reduces the fat content of foods because the fat is replaced by protein. However, it is not calorie-free. For example, i/‘2 cup of regular ice cream has 130 calories and t/2 cup of an ice cream made with Simplesse has 120 calories. This shows the importance of reading labels when choosing foods to include in your diet. Fat substitutes in foods may be helpful in reducing the total fat content of our diet, but we should not rely on them alone to give us better health.",
