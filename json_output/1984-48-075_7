Jackaon said reaearch money la coming from chemical companiea so that \u201cenergy inputs have ^fniLigiral mechanisms \u201d    He feels the school of agriculture and biological science need to break traditional patterns of specialization and merge together their research data from both I fields to improve the problems in agriculture.    Stein noted that sustainable agriculture is still in its infancy, with basic research just being started.    In order for it to work, members believe, a greater understanding and cooperation with all life forces needs to exist.    People need to develop farms as small ecosystems Stein said. Where animal manure can be used to fertilise soil which feeds the animals. To prevent erosion and a loos of nutrients, crops can be rotated.

Like nature, the costs are cychcaL Farms are sprayed with pesticidss and insect iridss which in turn leach into the soil with winter raina. Man consumes animals that have eaten chemically treated grasses. The end result is contamination of the drinking water and a higher incidence of cancer in humans.   Jerry Harbinson, a graduate student said that every time an oQ shortage occurs, the cost of fertilizer skyrockets, which in turn brings up tho cost of food.   \u201cThe pries of lettuce on your table shouldn't be dependent on a barrel of ojl,\u201c he said.
