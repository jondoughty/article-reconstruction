    "article_text": "A proposal to channel funds used for faculty merit awards to alternative programs will go before the executive committee of the Academic Senate Tuesday. The proposal, authored by Academic Senate Chairman Lloyd Lamouria, would eliminate the Meritorious Performance and Professional Promise (MPPP) awards distributed annually to faculty members. It suggests the distribution of funds currently used for the award to “enrich such already established, but inadequately funded, faculty development programs.’’ These programs include sabbatical leaves, travel funds, grants for research and conferences to be used for professional development. The 123 awards of $2,500 each are distributed proportionately to the seven schools on campus. Funds were allocated from the state budget to create the MPPP. Approval by the executive committee would send the proposal to a meeting of the full senate April 14. Although passage of the proposal would not initiate action on the part of the senate, it would represent “the Academic Senate’s stand on the issue,’’ said Lamouria. Lamouria said the proposal reiterates the position taken by the senate a few years ago. “We didn’t agree with the MPPP awards to start with,’’ he said. “We feel that they are divisive as far as the faculty goes.’’ Adelaide Harmon-Elliott, Cal Poly president of the California Faculty Association, said that the MPPP awards were agreed on as a compromise’ during the final round of contract negotiations three years ago. The CFA is a union that serves as the elected bargaining agen\\ for Cal Poly faculty members. “The CFA asked for more money for professional develop- ment. said Harmon-Elliott. “The eSU ^ wanted a merit system. The compromise ended up to be the MPPP.’’ A factfinder settled the dispute with the following agreement:\tthe faculty through the Academic Senate would devise the criteria for the awards, and deans would make the final decision based on faculty input. Physics professor Thomas Schumann said, however, that faculty members have little input into who receives the awards aside from the nomination of potential recipients. “There’s no clear criteria for the award,’’ he said. “The final decision is President (Warren) Baker’s. He can veto any nominee.’’ Schumann added that administrators work as a team, and that the Academic Senate accepts what the Administration asks for “The decision is made, and you never know who made it or who they discussed it with. The whole thing is very nebulous,’’ he said. “I think there is a possibility of misuse.’’ Articles appearing in Mustang Daily in May 1985 reported a “purely random selection process’’ used by schools such as Professional Studies to select nominees for approval by the dean. Five of the seven schools, however, said that no random selection process was used. At that time, only 39 awards for a total of nearly $100,000 were given. Lamouria said nominations for the award are forwarded by department heads to an elected school committee, which forwards its recommendations to the school dean. If the dean ap-See MERIT, back page proves the nominee, the awards are announced. In the case of a disagreement on the dean’s part, the nominee’s application is forwarded to Baker. Only a small percentage of the nominations ever reach the president, he said. The awards exist throughout the CSU system, and are encouraged by the Chancellor’s Office and the state Legislature, said Lamouria. Schumann said the yearly total of 123 awards totalling $300,000 could influence people’s behavior. “It could cause them to not criticize. the Administration in fear that their nomination might be turned down,’’ he said. Threats to faculty members’ tenure or promotions could inhibit instructors from voicing an opinion on university and controversial issues, said Schumann. “There is a history of fear of retaliation at this university.’’ He added that professors often speak up on issues after they have become tenured, but non-tenured faculty members “just don’t like to make waves.’’ Although the awards have been opposed by both the CFA and the Academic Senate, faculty members stand on both sides of the issue. Lamouria said that like any issue, MPPP awards have those who support the idea and those who don’t. Harmon-Elliott said current contract negotiations are in the fact-finding stage, and that the CFA has asked for MPPP awards to be eliminated in the new contract. “We have asked for the money to be dumped into professional development,” she said, adding that faculty members are required by contract to participate in professional development activities. She said the CFA hopes to have its answer on the issue by the end of April.",
