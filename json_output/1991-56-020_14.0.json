    "article_text": "Charles Howard had been up since 7 a.m. rustling through the Daily Racing Form in search of standings on a former Cal Poly horse. “Have you found her yet?” asked animal science professor Roger Hunt, looking over his shoulder, a cup of coffee steaming in the cold morning air. “Not yet ... we look through this every morning... it’s our Bible,” Howard said as he motioned to the group of students gathered at Cal Poly’s Horse Unit in the early morning hours. The group of students laughed and quietly agreed. The horse. Cal Poly Time, has done quite well for herself since she graduated from Cal Poly’s Thoroughbred Enterprise Program two years ago. The filly won her first race last year, earning over $17,000. The Enterprise students has seen her name in the Daily Racing Form more than once. The Thoroughbred Enterprise Program was introduced to Cal Poly in 1941. The California Thoroughbred Breeders Association initiated the program with donations of brood mares and stallion services. Cal Poly students hand-raised these horses until they were ready for sale. In 1970, Poly went beyond breeding, and entered the training ring. The program began selling horses at the March Invitational Sale in Del Mar each March. Some horses currently in the program will sell for up to $15,000, Hunt said. “The program is unique to the West Coast,” said Hunt, who has been supervisor since 1978. “I haven’t heard of any other program like it anywhere.” Hunt said thoroughbred racing is one of the most dangerous and expensive sports in the world, but it is also one of the most rewarding. “Riding these horses strengthens a person’s character,” Hunt said. “And it changes a person forever.” Cal Poly’s Thoroughbred Enterprise Program has now sold more than 100 horses. Sixty-one of those have been winners on the West Coast, earning an lifetime average to date of $25,000. Altogether, Cal Poly’s Thoroughbreds have earned a total of $1,529,893 at the track. There are seven students involved in this year’s program, and three 18-month-old Thoroughbreds. The students accepted into the program must complete a series of classes, know how to ride and have a career goal in the horse industry. “Our number one goal is to help these students become better horsepeople,” Hunt said. “It doesn’t matter what type of horse they ride or what event, but these kids are going to learn something about themselves. Just like the horses learn.” Kimberly Loeb, an animal science junior, plans on working in equine veterinary medicine. specifically in leg care. She hopes her year with the Thoroughbred Program will give her a head start in her career. “We are as inexperienced as they (the horses) are,” Loeb said. “It’s hard to get two beginners to come together and learn something, but we’re doing it.” Tbday, Loeb is working with Decko, a temperamental colt who seems anxious to get out of the bam. “We’re lucky,” Loeb said as she brushed clean Decko’s back. “He’s acting very good right now.” Loeb is looking forward to March, and the Thoroughbred sales in Del Mar. “I’m the type of person who gets attached to animals,” Loeb said. “But I’ll be very proud of him (Decko) if he makes it to the track. I will have really helped accomplish something.” Animal science senior Amy Weston agreed. “This is an opportunity I might not get anywhere else,” she said. Hunt said many of the students meet important contacts at the track. From page 5 “The industry is supportive of us, and they’re really interested in it (the program),” Hunt said. “Obviously someone is interested, they are buying our horses. And the exposure and education is good for our students.” Jeff Miner, an animal science junior, is looking forward to riding on the track. “It’s a different style of riding,” Miner said as he saddled up a second colt. Hoist the Hour. “But it’s all horsemanship and the more experience you get, the better you will be.” “Horses are a luxury,” he added with a smile. “If I can make a living with them, that wouldn’t be too bad.” Hoist the Hour was “feeling good” this morning as Miner let him run in the training ring. The colt kicked at a metal wall and the sound echoed through the quiet morning air. Hunt stood by the ring and kept a watchful eye on his two new students. T^is was the second week the horses had felt a person’s weight on their backs. “We aren’t breaking these horses,” Hunt said. “You break a match stick ... you educate a horse.” Down below the training ring lies a 3/4 mile race track, built in 1984 by the Oak tree Racing Association. It won’t be long before these three young horses will get the chance to test their speed. Hunt said. Animal science senior Lori Johnston was in last year’s Enterprise Program. She showed up this morning to watch the new hopefuls. “This really becomes your passion,” said Johnston, who rode at Del Mar track last year. “Y>u just want to go faster and faster. There is nothing like it (horse racing). It’s almost addictive.” Hunt said the training program will be moving to Rancho Rio Vista Stables in Atascadero later this year because he wants to keep the program abreast of the latest technology and Rancho Rio Vista has much newer facilities. “Everyone thinks they just come up here to ride, but it’s more than that,” Hunt said. “They learn about conditioning. dedication and patience.” As the enterprise students led their horses down to the track, a group of yearlings watched curiously from a nearby pasture. Hunt said some of them would be in next year’s Enterprise Program. “And the tradition will continue,” he said. “That is what it’s all about.”",
