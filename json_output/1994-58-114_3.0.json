    "article_text": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Nelson Mandela proclaimed victory Monday in his lifetime crusade: a non-racial democracy for South Africa. As his supporters let loose in ecstatic celebration, the nation’s first black president declared, “Free at last!” “This is indeed a joyous night for the human spirit,” said the 75-year-old leader. “This is your victory too. Supporters shrieked with joy in a hotel ballroom draped in the green-gold-and-black colors of Mandela’s African National Congress. The celebrations spilled over into the black districts of Soweto and Alexandra, where thousands of people poured into the streets dancing ecstatically, laughing and waving ANC flags. Mandela himself joined in the jubilation with Coretta Scott King, widow of U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., and former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda. A choir sang the praises of “Madiba,” Mandela’s traditional clan name. Earlier, President F.W. de Klerk of the National Party acknowledged defeat in South Africa’s first democratic elections. He praised Mandela as “a man of destiny” and pledged to work with him in the new government of national unity scheduled to be installed in eight days. Mandela in turn congratulated de Klerk “for the many days, weeks and months and the four years that we have worked together, quarreled, addressed sensitive problems, and at the end of our heated exchanges were able to shake hands and to drink coffee.” The two leaders navigated the country through an extraordinary transition in which an oppressive white minority surrendered its privileges to the black majority. Both sides promised to forgive the past and build one nation. ANC officials stood before their new national flag and raised their glasses in a toast in honor of outgoing President de Klerk, incoming President Mandela and the “new South Africa.” “I stand before you filled with deep pride and joy — pride in the ordinary, humble people of this country,” said Mandela. “You have shown such a calm, patient determination to reclaim this country as your own. And joy that we can loudly proclaim from the rooftops — free at last!” Although ballot officials remained less than halfway through the counting, an ANC landslide was indisputable. With about 44 percent of the estimated 22.7 million votes counted, the ANC .had 62.6 percent to 23.7 percent for de Klerk’s National Party. The Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party was a distant third with 6.2 percent, followed by the proapartheid Freedom Front with 2.8 percent. The ANC was projected to win around 240 seats in the new 400-seat Parliament, which will select Mandela as president Friday. De Klerk’s concession speech was attended by about 300 people at National Party headquarters in Pretoria. “Next Tuesday I shall lay down my responsibilities as state president,” de Klerk said. “I shall be handing over the presidency to Mr. Mandela.” “Mr. Mandela has walked a long road and now stands at the top of the hill,” he said of the ANC leader, who spent 27 years in prison for opposing the policies imposed by de Klerk’s party. “I hold out my hand to Mr. Mandela in friendship and in cooperation.” De Klerk is expected to serve as one of two vice presidents. “During the past four years. we have proved that we can work together,” de Klerk said. “Our relationship has become a symbol of the ability of South Africans from widely different backgrounds to cooperate in the national interest.” De Klerk told The Associated Press that the National Party “will in due course become the biggest party in South Africa. “This was the freedom election, the next will be about economic policy. In the 1999 election, the National Party will be the winning party,” he said. De Klerk, 58, took office in 1989 and was expected to continue the hard-line policies of his predecessor, P.W. Botha. He shocked the world by announcing the imminent end of apartheid, and freed Mandela from a life prison term. Within months the two men had launched negotiations that led to a new constitution guaranteeing equal rights for blacks and whites, and clearing the way for all-race elections.",
