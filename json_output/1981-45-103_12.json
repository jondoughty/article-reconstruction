    "article_text": "Days before local hearings to decide whether the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant will be fired up for low-power testing, an attorney for plant opponents on campus Thursday assailed PG&E's nuclear track record and questioned credibility of the utility’s pronouncements. Speaking in UU 112, W. Andrew Baldwin, the lawyer representing the legal intervenors in Utigation cqncerning the plant’s security system, said the pubUc is caught between two sides on the issue of Diablo Canyon’s safety. “PG'&E says the plant is safe, but can we believe them?” he said. In answer to his own question, Baldwin detailed several incidents which occurred during the utility’s attempts to build and operate five nuclear power plants in California since 1955. He also cited a court decision which found PG&E guilty of libeling a television documentary producer. Beginning with the VallMitos power plant near San Jose, Baldwin ran down a list of nuclear power projects undertaken by PG&E, all of which were found to be on or near earthquake faults. These included:^\t\" —a nuclear plant at Humboldt Bay, closed in 1975 for refueling and never reopened due to seismic hazards and leaking fuel. —the abortive Bolinas Bay plant, which was blocked by the Alo™<^ Energy Commission before construction began because of its proximity to the San Andreas fault. —a proposal to build a nuclear reactor at Point Avena, near Mendocino in northern California, which was also halted, Baldwin said, by the U.S. Geological Survey when it discovered PG&E was withholding seismic data indicating the presence of an earthquake fault. —the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power plant, located two and a half miles from the Hosgri fault, which Baldwin said PG&E knew about in 1971, but did not inform the Nuclw Regulatory Commission until 1973. ’The Humboldt Bay power station was the subject of a KNBC-’TV, Los Angeles-produced documentary titled When C^fornia State Sen. H.L. Richardson Jr. first entered politics, he found tliat politicians don’t care about beM solutions. “Money and Politics in California” was the title of the address given by the 25th District Republican senator from Arcadia. A former advertising and pt^lk relations executive, Richardson has been identified with conservative politics over the years. \"Politicians don’t give a damn about what’s best — they go into politics to force their ideas on others.” Richardson told an audience of about 80 people in the University Union’s Room 220 Thursday morn^. \"Intellectual pursuits are not a part of politics. It’s a battle, and I soon learned to play ball within those re-quirements.” Richardson maintained that there are five major myths of politics and listed them as: —\tPolitical daeitioHt arc eompromiccM. According to Richardson, those decisions are conflicU and the sUte senate is not a reflective body, as it diould be. —\tPotitieiaiu art clactad by a majority. ’The senator hold that voters dact politicians, and the majority of eligible voters don’t vote. —\tPoUtieiant arc “twccty-cwccty\" people. Richard-*8on said the politicians he’s dealt with are people who get what they want. —\tLegislators read everything they vote on. He said they read perhaps a third of what they vote on, and voting on 20 bills with one vote is not uncommon. —\tTalking with a politician will change his or her mind. “It all boils down to thejact that the legislatUve process we have today is the worst way to solve problems,” said the senator. \"To say a state senator can represent 6,0(X) people is stupid.” According to Rkhiudson, C^fornia would be bdter off if lawmakers were part-time politicians who worked with citizens to reach solutions. Richardson stated kis conclusion and opened the floor to questions. Cal Poly poliHical science professor David George began a question regarding the Second Amendment and Richardson, founder a^ chairman of Gun Owners of America and Gun Owners of California, said loudly, “I will not disctiss the Second Amendment!” Mambws of the audience responded by firing repeated questions at the senator about his stance on gun owner-riiip. Taking the idea of personal freedoms a step further, a young man asked the speaker how he felt about abortion, gay rights, and marijuana. \"The Powers ’That Be,” which explored the issue of furi problems and seismic safety of the plant. After the show was aired, PG&E officials drew up a letter accusing th^ocumentary’s producer of secretly taping a utility offi<^ on the subject of the safety of the furi at the plant, Baldwin said. ’The note said the produced taped the remarks clandestinely, then edited the film to make it appear that the official was speaking on camera. Baldwin said.\t^ ’The letter, according to Baldwin was sent to congressmen, goverorhent agencies and the Atomic Energ^y Commission among other places, and the producer sued for libel, claiming his reputation would be damaged.' Under questioning during the trial, the PG&E official who made the accusations admitted he had indeed made the contentious remarks on the record. Baldwin said a jury found that PG&E did libel the producer and awarded him S7 million in damages. An appeals court found that amount excessive, however, and a settlement in lower court netted him 1400,000.\t^ 'The former legal director for the San Francisco-basbd Friends of the Earth, said PG&E’s motivation in this incident was to prevent further showings of this documentary, which they felt was \"full of innuendoes, half truths, and biased.” 'The lawyer, who has worked for the San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace and other legal intervenors for over two years, also read from PG&E documents instructions concerning the screening and destruction of files to prevent detrimental information about the utility’s activities from becoming public. A PG&E representative was at the talk, but refused to comment on Baldwin’s remarks for the record. He also declined to give his name to a reporter. WASHIN'tON lAP) — Twenty-six Libyan diplomats left the United States under President Reagan’s expulsion order early today after their chief delivered a parting shot: a threat to cut off oil shipments in retaliation. Reagan issued the order last week after the State Department alleged that Libya and the People’s Bureau, its mission in Washington, had engaged in ’’provocations and misconduct, including support for international terrorism.\" Hours before his departure. Ali el Houderi, Libya’s top diplomat In the United States, said a halt in oil sales to the United States is one option under consideration by his government. Libya provides about 10 percent of U.S. oil imports for about $12 billion a year. U.S. officials have charged that Libya has intimidated dissident Libyans in this country and, aided by Soviet military equipment, has intervened in dozens of other nations, most of them friendly to the United States. The State Department said it saw no reason why the expulsion of the diplomats should affect oil trade with Libya.\t~ i Asked Wednesday about Houderi’s comments. State Department spokesman Dean Fischer declined to discuss the ‘‘hypothetical’’ possibility of an oil cutoff. MX vyon’t get Columbia River SALEM, Ore. AP—Oregon Gov. Vic Atiyeh said Thursday he would oppose any effoils to divert Columbia River water to Nevada for the proposed MX missile project. \"1 don’t want to be dramatic about this,’’ he said. \"I’m absolutely adamant that nobody’s going to get Columbia River water.”\t,: Atiyeh said there is no water to spare ifrom the river, which serves Oregon, Washington and Idaho. He said if Nevada officials demanded Sacramento River water, they would get the same reaction from California officials. The furnaces in the Cal Poly glassblowing lab line up against the wall like square, squat animals, roaring and glowing an eerie orange. As a student slides open a door to collect a lump of white-hot molten glass on the end of his blowpipe, intense heat pours out into the lab and warms the damp, early morning air~ of an overcast day.\ti For the beginning students of Art 242, it's “Smoothie Day,\" according to glassblowing teacher George Jercich. If the ' students have suC(:eeded in blowing a drinking glass or cup, they get to try them out by drinking smoothies, a drink con-, taining ice cream and fruit. \"It's an incentive,\" said Jercich. “No glass, no smoothie.\" For the advanced students, like Ralph Johnson and Bill Hedges.'it's time to practice and experiment with their glassblowing skills. Johnson, a 25-year-old crop science and poultry major, said he has been blowing glass for almost a year. What began as a side interest for him may become a professional career \"if farming doesnit pan out,\" said Johnson. One of his works, a \"slump bowl,\" is on display in the U.U. Galerie show,\"Selections '81.\" Johnson is presently working on his \"Confettie Series.\" \"1 got tired of making wine glasses,\" he said. \"I'm moving off into other territories.\" Describing his series idea as new wave, Johnson works with basic shapes of glass, and adds random places of color creating the \"confetti effect.” Johnson coats his blowpipe with a white liner before applying the molten glass, which turns the clear glass white. “It's a white background for me to paint on,\" said Johnson. One of Johnson's fellow students, Frank Zike, called him the class's \"most advanced student.\" “He's bean around here the longest,\" said Zike. “He's very serious about his work.\" Bill Hedges, 23, is an architecture student who has blown glass since last fall. He said he always enjoyed watching glassblowers and thought he would give it a try. Since that decision, he said he spends about four hours a week in the lab practicing at his hobby. “Why does an archie blow glass?” he asked. “Because it’s fun.” - recognizes the need for additional financing in the state budget and will include a cover letter outlining recommended tuition alternatives, and it will l>e sent to the state legislature The ASI attempted to remedy the problem of low student awareness of ASI by passing a bill which e.stablishes an educational campaign similar to the one staged before the fee increaseelection. The bill delegates authority to the student relations board and student ativities information director to implement a full media campaign that will be funded by ASI and will attempt to educate students on the various services and programs of the ASI. Three controversial bills were rejected by the body after considerable debate. Two bills dealt with guidelines for approval or suspension of bylawed and coded groups and would have required either a biennial or yearly report and assessment of their programs. One bill propo.sed a $1.50 per member assessment for each club to defray T)usTness office costs, but this proposal was voted out of the bill before it and the other guidelines bill died due to a lack of a two-thirds majori-ty. Another debate ensued over a bill to change the ASI election dates to the first two weeks of spring quarter and the filing period to the last two weeks of winter quarter. The proposed budget was explained in detail by finance committee chair Peter Schuster, and Huff announced a special meeting Monday at 8 p.m. to hear budget appeals and iron out problems before approval next Wednesday. Saacial to m# Dally All season long, Cad Poly head track coach Steve Miller has been telling us how good his team is this year, about all the depth on his squad, and how his team is going to destroy all opposition en route to the conference and national championships. fhis weekend, we'll find out just how true the Words of Steve Miller are. The Mustangs travel to exotic downtown Bakersfield for the California Collegiate. Athletic Association ^championships this afternoon and Saturday. At stake will be not only the conference title and bragging rights for a year, but also a legion of individual matchups that will most probably be replayed at the national championships in Macomb, 111. in two weeks.\t--t, For example, take the 1500 race. Please. Toeing the starting line will be Poly’s aces, Vernon Sajlax and Paul Medvin, along ' with the nation's top metric miler, Frank Assunima of Riverside, Matt Blaty and Pedro Reyes of Pomona, and Ken Haney of Bakersfteld. All six runners are capable of running 3:45 or better. Another of those events that will have the fans on the edge of their seats will be the sprints, where Poly's Mark Kent and possibly Joe Siai Siai will clash with Northridge’s Steve Brodie the' former national sprint champion. In fact, the entire Nor-thridge team will prove to be the Mustangs' biggest pest at Bakersfield. The Matadors go two and three deep in each of the field events, and could heavily outscore Poly in the field events without winning an event. If Mu^ng Brian Paul wins the^^t put, as he’s expected ^ do, and Northridge geth second, third, and fifth, the Matadors would win the shot put, 18-10. Said Miller, \"According to the conference listing alone, Northridge could score 14 in the long jump, 17 in the triple jump, 12 in the discus and 21 in the hammer. They could be competitive without winning an event.” Aside from the key matchups, Miller, as always, is looking for his athletes to continue improving, and to return to the form they were in before the onslaught of invitationals took some of the \"oomph” out of the season. But this is somewhat like the case of the person who had nose siu-gery, but was afraid to take off the bandages for fear that his nose won't come out just as he wanted. One of the ironies of the conference meet is that Miller and friends won’t be able to show off the depth on the team. In 1981, 41 individuals and two relays have qualifîed for the na-tiohals, yet the Mustangs can take only 28 athletes to the conference meet. With the conference title on the line. Miller won’t fiddle around ~ with his lineup. Doug Avrit, a 5000 nmner in the nationals, will run the 10000 in Bakersfield, while senior Susan King was the top all-around performer for the Mustangs, and scored 31.65 in the conference meet. Donna Haas (31.55) and Pam Dickey (31.30) also were select^ to the first team all-league. The Mustangs won the SC A A conference in mid-March. Cal State Northridge, who placed fourth in the league, had two athletes selected. Kim Gardner was the top gynmast with a 34.25 score. Susie Freeman (33.0) was the other Matador named. Cal Poly Pomona’s Cindy Sunnar-borg (31.70) rounded out the six-member team. The Mustangs enjoyed their finest season ever in 1981. Besides capturing the team’s first SCAA crown, Proctor’s squad placed 11th in the Mustangs’ first appearance at the AIAW Division II Nationals. Proctor is the third coach from Cal Poly to be honored by the SCAA this year. Lance Harter was named coach of the year for cross country, while Mike Wilton was selected for volleyball. The man who holds the position of Secretary of the Interior is'charged with both the preservation and development of public lands—roughly one-fifth of all the land in the United ' States, or more than four hundred million acres, most of it in the West and Alaska. He administers mining leases, decides the fate of one billion acres on the outer continental shelf, manages 300 national parks and is charged with preserving endangered species. Such a man should hold the environment, the natural beauty of our national heritage, above short-term profit and out of the reach of those sections of private industry that have no concept of the value of life, of health, of the true glories of our earth.\t^ Secretary of the Interior James Watt has proven time and again he lacks the empathy with nature to hold this position. Since his appointment, he has: —halted expenditure of funds for the acquisition of land for national parks, including parks whose purchase Congress has already authorized. —fired the entire professional staff of the Council on Environmental Quality, whose function is to see that federal agencies carry out the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. —plans to open up 100 million acres of federal land in Alaska for oil and gas leases by the end of the year,' despite the lack of time to do federally mandated environmental studies. —has opened up sections of the California coast for oil and ' gàs drilling while ignoring the state's recommendations and pushing aside federal laws protecting rafé species such drilling would endang^^'‘He has also hinted he will allow drilling in marine sanctuaries. —proposes to make it easier for companies to strip mine without facing the cost of reclaiming the area. —proposes to legalize “denning\": going into coyote dens and clubbing the cubs to death.\t' —backs weakening of air- and water-pollution contrpls. —backs weakening of laws forbidding the hunting and importing of rare species. The people Walt has chosen and endorsed to surround him in Washington damn him as much as his actions: — Anne Gorsuch, radically pro-development, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. —William Coldiron, former general counsel of the Montana Power Co., as solicitor of the Interior Department. —John Crowell as head,of the Forest Department, the largest public-land manager outside Interior. Crowell is a former lobbyist for one of the country’s largest timber cutters and has frequently denounced the Forest Service and its goal of setting aside forests for wilderness areas. \"I will err on the side of public versus preservation.” \"What is the real motive of the extreme environmentalists who appear to be determined to accomplish their objective at whatever cost to society? Is it to simply protect the environment? Is it to delay and deny energy development? Is it to weaken America?” \"We will use the budget system to be the excuse to make majSr policy decisions.” \"I’m out to make decisions and I will make them quickly...! make lots of mistakes 'cause I make a lot of decisions.” “No other Secretary of the Interior, in recent times at least, has had a president who understands my department like Ronald Reagan does...When I said, ‘I want to do this, I want to do that,’ he replied, ’Sic ’em.’ ” \"We must inventory the land and it doesn’t matter if it's covered with trees, grass or water.” \"We have institutionalized the environmental movement. We have done a good job of that, so these preservationist groups have got to preserve themselves. They must look for a cause.” Anyone who thinks environmentalists must actually search out a cause to fìght for, as if there aren’t enough thrown in their faces, clearly should not be Interior Secretary. Moves are underway to get him dismissed by Congress, and petitions are circulating to that effect. Sign one, circulate a few—they are available at ECO—SLO, 985 Palm St., San Luis Obispo. Watt was in his niche as advisor for the pro-development Mountain States Legal Foundation. Help him find his home, his place in society—send him packing from the Interior Department. Next Tuesday the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission begins what may well be the final hearings on whether Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant should be issu^ a low-power test license. How can the meml^s of the Cal Poly community who are opposed to the licensing effectively express their feelings? 1.\tSign the petitions circulating on campus and in town which call attention 'to the lack of emergency evacuation plans and emergency medical facilities for the area land, for that matter, as far as is known, for the campusl; 2.\tBe at a special rally next Monday night at the Mission from 7:30 to 8:30; 3.\tTake part in a march next Tuesday morning which will leave from the U.U. Plaza at 8:20 for the Discovery Inn where the hearings will be held (you will be able to be back on campus in time for your 9:30 classesl. Recently, the NRC has \"proposed regulations that would significantly reduce the public's right to gather information for use at licensing hearings.” The former Chair, Joseph Hendrie, has asked Congress to provide legislation to speed up the licensing process including \"permitting the MRC to authorize/fuelloading and low-power testing of nfw reactors before licensing hearings are completed.\" Within the past week the Administration has proposed a new chair for the conunission, thus attempting to fill a vacancy and allowing the entire commission to vote on all matters under its jurisdiction. Because of the qiecial conditions surrounding Diablo Canyon there will be national news coverage of the hearings and related events. A solid turnout is crucial to the success of the rally and the march. Your active inipport is needed now!\tRichaH Kranxdorf",
