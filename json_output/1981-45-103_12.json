    "article_text": "The student senate continued to wade through the flood of new legislation introduced two weeks ago, as it passed two 1)1118 and one resolution and killed three other bills after considerable debate Wednesday The board also postponed two proposals for fur- ther revision as it attempted to clear its legislative agenda and make room for the upcoming budget hearings next week. After examining documents on alternative financing and survey results on the effects of tuition, senators passed a resolution which indicates the ASlâ€™s opposition to resident tuition for CSUC students. The\tresolution recognizes the need for additional financing in the state budget and will include a cover letter outlining recommended tuition alternatives, and it will l>e sent to the state legislature The ASI attempted to remedy the problem of low student awareness of ASI by passing a bill which e.stablishes an educational campaign similar to the one staged before the fee increaseelection. The bill delegates authority to the student relations board and student ativities information director to implement a full media campaign that will be funded by ASI and will attempt to educate students on the various services and programs of the ASI. Three controversial bills were rejected by the body after considerable debate. Two bills dealt with guidelines for approval or suspension of bylawed and coded groups and would have required either a biennial or yearly report and assessment of their programs. One bill propo.sed a $1.50 per member assessment for each club to defray T)usTness office costs, but this proposal was voted out of the bill before it and the other guidelines bill died due to a lack of a two-thirds majori-ty. Another debate ensued over a bill to change the ASI election dates to the first two weeks of spring quarter and the filing period to the last two weeks of winter quarter. The proposed budget was explained in detail by finance committee chair Peter Schuster, and Huff announced a special meeting Monday at 8 p.m. to hear budget appeals and iron out problems before approval next Wednesday.",
