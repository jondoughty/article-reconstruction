    "article_text": "I am writing about the recent approval by the County Board of Supervisors for on- and offshore oil manufacturing. I am a primary source, that is, I speak from my own first-hand experience with oil drilling off and on the coast of Santa Barbara and Ventura. These oil companies have been, and remain to be, notorious for misleading the public and downright lying to them. I lived in Santa Barbara and Goleta for nearly 16 years. I moved to San Luis Obispo permanently one year ago. I am a tar refugee. When I first moved to Santa Barbara in 1971, the beaches were surrounded by beautiful white cliffs and rocks. You could swim in the water and the tar was hardly noticeable — just small flecks here and there. Then we had an oil slick (my first of several), in which many types of marine life were sacrificed. Volunteers cleaned it off the beaches, not the oil company, who was at fault. They did not even clean it out of the water this first time! Of course, the oil company managed to keep that quiet and at a later date, claimed they had participated in the slick cleanup. But that is not true. I was there. Volunteers had to try and wash off birds and baby seals that were paralyzed by the oil and tar. Still the majority died. Does anyone care? It does not seem so in Santa Barbara, where money talks and values walk. Did you know that the United States only produces 2 percent of the oil it consumes? Nowadays in the Santa Barbara and Ventura area you cannot walk along the beach without wearing your “tar” shoes or “beach” shoes because you will get a new sole on them every time (made of tar). There are very few rocks and cliffs along the beach that remain white — most are black with tar coating. Almost every bathing suit and pair of shorts I own have tar/oil stains because you cannot avoid it there. 1 have been trying to escape it, but now they want to start here. Before you know it, there will be no clean coastline left. I watched the oil/tar problem progressively and steadily increase in the water, and on the beaches, in direct proportion with the increase in oil platforms built. Basically, it comes down to oil company money. As we have seen over the past decade plus, a good part of government is corrupt. And the root of the corruption, most often, is money. So these two go together, hand in hand, each feeding the other. Did you know that the government very suddenly attempted to disban the Coastal Commission? It is one of the only public check systems we have in our favor against the oil companies ruining our coast. Remember when two tankers collided at Point Conception a few months ago? It took three days before it was admitted that one carried oil and there was no mention of the condition of marine life that was involved. Just because we use a resource does not mean we need to abuse it. This attitude of taking all you can get without regard for your future and your childrens’ futures really scares me today. I look forward to our generation moving forward and showing the country we can find other ways to make petrol or petrol substitutes. We can eliminate greed and bring forth caring, concern and respect for our planet and its limited resources. Take an active step and vote if you can.",
