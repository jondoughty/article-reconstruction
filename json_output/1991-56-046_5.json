LOS ANGELES (AP) — Charles Keating Jr., the free-spending, politically connected executive whose rise and fall came to epitomize the S&L debacle, faces up to 10 years in prison for defrauding junk bond investors. Keating sat grim-faced in Superior Court on Wednesday, his 68th birthday, as a jury found him guilty of 17 of 18 counts of duping investors about the safety of junk bonds sold through his now-collapsed Lincoln Savings & Loan. The bonds became worthless when Lincoln went under in a collapse that cost taxpayers $2.6 billion, the most expensive government bailout in U.S. history. “It’s the nicest birthday present he could give us — to find the S.O.B. guilty and send him to jail,” exulted Jeri Mellon, leader of a support group for those who bought the bonds. She lost $40,000 in Lincoln’s collapse. “There is a God!” cried Mimi Hines, who said her junk bond losses cost her a $1.2 million Malibu home. “It would be a gi*eat birthday present for him if he gets 68 years.

One of the jurists who complained most loudly about the artwork was U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian, who in a letter to Roybal called the baby sculpture a “shrine to pedophiles.” The sculpture had been installed in the central plaza of the high-rise building, which is scheduled to open next month. Welt said Otterness could decide to sue under the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, designed to protect artists from alteration of their work. The work showed a woman squatting and a baby girl lying on her back, legs open and up, holding a globe. Both show genitals and are typical of Otterness’ nude figures. The figures were the central element of a $266,000 work called “The New World,” whose However, the untested law exempts “works for hire.” It is unclear whether the sculpture would be construed as “work for hire” and whether works commissioned by the federal government are covered by the law. “But his goal...is to see his work displayed in the public space for which it was created,” Welt said.
