    "article_text": "Well, it’s over. Finally. And not a minute too soon. In fact, the Academy Awards show lasted exactly three hours and 21 minutes too long. On Monday this annual Hollywood extravaganza forced itself upon the American public and was received about as warmly as a pop quiz. Except, unlike a pop quiz, we were warned about the Academy Awards. We knew they were coming. They’ve been coming at us live from Hollywood for 59 obnoxious years. And they’ll keep coming, just like the flu. Actually, the show wouldn’t be so bad if only the meaningful parts were televised. Does the television audience really need to know that “ ’Round Midnight” had the best score? What was the score, anyway? By how much did it win? And does the man on the street really care that “Precious Images” was the best live-action short film? Maybe. But then why talk turkey and award prizes for the things people are really interested in. don’t they give an award for the best non-action long film? Ronald Reagan’s last news conference would be a good nominee. To continue in the true spirit of the awards, perhaps the academy ought to consider the following meaningful categories for next year’s presentation: Best Valet Parker at the Studio Parking Lot — Nominees will be judged on their speed, attire and knowledge of restaurants within a 10-mile radius. Most Original Excuse for the Film Going Over Budget — Directors and producers have come up with some creative ones and the Academy should recognize the genius of these artists. Worst Actor/Actress — Let’s The awards are well on their way to becoming the most lavish, excessive and exorbitant non-event in the history of mankind. All the show needs is a few extra categories to stretch the presentation into a two-day fashion parade and it would be, without a doubt, the most worthless program ever endured by human audiences. Although the Academy Awards are based on an ideal of recognizing artistic excellence in the movie industry, they’ve become an evening devoted to activities that don’t interest anybody but the actors and ac- t tresses themselves. Maybe if the television viewing public is lucky, next year’s envelope will say “Program canceled due to lack of interest.”",
