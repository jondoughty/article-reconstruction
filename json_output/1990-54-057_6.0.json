    "article_text": "F^ilor — It seems to me, after reading last week’s Mustang Daily, if someone is going to be great, famous and remembered, he or she must be perfect in every way, shape and form. While I might not like Martin Luther King Jr. for his values or infidelities, I do like what he represented as a symbol. King is not alone in his infidelities and hidden beliefs. Thomas Jefferson was unfaithful to his wife; when he died, he left his estate to one of his slaves, his mistress. Abraham Lincoln wasn’t perfect; while giving his Emancipation Proclamation, he was smuggling slaves to a secret island. I could go on, but it is not my point to batter American immortals. King was not as perfect as we might think, but he was not alone either. These men all did great things for America and stupid, hypocritical, immoral acts in their private lives. Where I do not think I could like these men as individuals, 1 do like what they have done for America. Jefferson gave us freedom in the Declaration of Independence. Lincoln stopped slavery through the Emancipation Proclamation. King made giant steps in the civil rights movement and the equality of man. I feel we should remember these men for what they did for us. They did give us something, didn’t they?",
