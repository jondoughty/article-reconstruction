    "article_text": "IRAQ (AP) \u2014 In its first statement on the missile attack that killed 28 servicemen aboard the USS Stark, Iraq said President Saddam Hussein had ordered a \u201cserious investigation\u201d to determine if the Iraqi air force was responsible. \u201cIraq would never intentionally attack any target in the gulf unless it was an Iranian target. If this attack was indeed carried out by Iraqi warplanes, then it would have been a result of confusion by the pilots,\u201d an unidentified Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman told the official Iraqi news agency. The spokesman urged U.S. officials to be patient until the investigation was done and said Iraq would \u201cpublicly announce the results of the investigation and apologize with sorrow\u201d if its air force was behind the attack. \u201cWe expect an apology and compensation for the men who died in this tragic incident,\u201d a White House statement said. \u201cWe also seek compensation for the ship.\u201d President Reagan expressed \u201cconcern and anger\u201d Monday over the missile strike and he put U.S. forces on heightened alert in the Persian Gulf with authority to fire at threatening warplanes. Vice Adm. Henry C. Mustin, deputy chief of Naval operations, said the ship knew it had been \u201clocked on\u201d by the warplane\u2019s radar \u2014 a prelude to attack \u2014 and that the Stark attempted twice by radio to warn the attacker that it was an American ship. He said it was not known whether the message was received.",
