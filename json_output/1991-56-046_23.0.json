    "article_text": "On the last day of this quarter, nomination fomis for the Distinguished Teachers of the year are due. Each year Cal Poly students are asked to nominate faculty members for the Distinguished Teachers Award. The award, which Ix'gan in the 1963-64 school year, is the university’s way of recognizing and encouraging faculty members for excellence in teaching. “The purpose (of the award) is to encourage g(K)d teaching,” said Harvey Greenwald, mathematics professor and chairman of the Ilistinguished Teachers Award Committee. Teachers are nominated during the fall quarter of each year by the student body via nomination forms, and the award committee selects the finalists the following quarter. During winter quarter, the nominations are narrowed down to approximately nine finalists. The committee then visits class-rcKim sessions of each finalist to determine three winners. “Each member of the committee will visit a (finalist’s) class-i(K)m, but they won’t know we are coming,” said Calvin Wilvert, committee member from the social sciences department. Wilvert received the distinguished teachers award for the 1986-87 school year. The winners are announced during spring quarter. Last year the committee selected five winners, two more than the unusual number. “The standard number of winners is three,” Greenwald said. “Last year the committee had a difficult time separating the finalists.” The award committee consists of five faculty members and two students. Nomination forms will be available in all classroom buildings and both the library and University Union information desks until the last day of the quarter. They can be turned into either the U.U. or library information desk.",
