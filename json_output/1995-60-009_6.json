    "article_text": "Discipline, determination and organization have earned Cal Poly’s Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity (Pikes) three national awards in the past five years. According to Grant Watkins, chapter president, the fraternity is one of 10 to receive the national award this year. We are the only (Pikes) in the Golden West region that received the award this year,” Watkins said. The Robert Adger Smythe award is based on numerous aspects of a fraternity: rush programs, membership development, management and operations, risk management awareness, alumni relations, finance, scholarship programs, public relations and community service. San Luis Obispo Mayor Allen Settle, who is the Pi Kappa Alpha faculty adviser, said winning the award for the third time was particularly impressive because the chapter is relatively new. They have only been on campus since 1987,” little said. It’s highly unusual that a fraternity, in the amount of time it has been on campus, has received such recognition.”It’s like winning three Academy Awards.\" Settle bases the fraternity’s success on the hard work of its members. This is a group of young people who have done a great job,” Settle said. ’They have the desire to get things done right the first time around.” According to Watkins, the fraternity members completed 3,400 hours of community service last year, which helped gain national recognition. The group chose to support the Dr^ Abuse Resistance Education program, their main philanthropy, and donated volunteer time and $250 from fund-raisers. Pi Kappa Alpha was started in the 1860s and has since included some prominent names. Settle said. You would be surprised to find out some of the people who are Pikes,” he said. *^d Koppel is a Pi Kappa Alpha. It’s a very well-recognized fraternity.”",
