    "article_text": "Organizations holding charity fund-raisers in the University Union will always have to pay a surcharge to ASI if a senator’s bill passes through the Student Senate. Senator Andy Herrick’s Bill 88-02 requires a 10 percent charge for all such organizations. As the rule stands now, according to Resolution 86-28, organizations holding charity fund-raisers in the U.U. can defer the surcharge — 10 percent of their total profit — if they petition the senate and the senate approves. The 10 percent charged to all fund-raisers is put into the Campus Improvement Fund and is the only source of income for it and the student planning commission. The commission reviews and donates money to student and faculty projects that beautify the campus. Apparently, more and m.ore organizations who have charity fund-raisers have been petitioning to have the surcharge waived, draining the commission’s resources. This issue was raised because last week Lambda Chi Alpha petitioned to get back the $400 surcharge it paid for its Thrash-a-Thon. The senate approved the request, reducing the commission’s account to $2,000. Herrick doesn’t agree with waiving the surcharge. But he has nothing against charities. “I think the student planning commission was overlooked in Resolution 86-28,” said Herrick, chairman of the commission. “Approximately 75 percent of all fund-raisers (held in the U.U.) are charitable,” he said. And if they all asked for their surcharge back, he said, the commission’s resources would be depleted. School of Engineering Senator Kyle Shepard, also on the commission, agrees with Herrick. “It’s vital for the bill to pass in order for the commission to continue at Cal Poly,” Shepard said. “Without the bill, we won’t have a funding source.” Herrick said another problem with Resolution 86-28 is it left the word “charitable” completely open to interpretation. This required the senate to interpret each petition, he said, and that takes a lot of the senate’s time. Bill 88-02 would put a $200 maximum limit to be paid per See CHARITY, page 4 Police detect stolen parking permits daily charity fund-raiser. Non-charity fund-raisers would pay the full 10 percent, even if the amount is more than $200. The senate will discuss the issue for two weeks, and then vote on it. The commission’s latest project is putting an entrance sign, like the ones on Grand Avenue and Highland Drive, on the California Boulevard entrance. It donated $1,000 to John Brody and David Eichten, both senior construction management majors, to make the sign for their senior projects. The commission is also responsible for other campus beautifications. In 1981, it gave $2,000 to build the Erhart bridge outside the Agriculture Building. In 1986, it donated more than $1,000 to build the Computer Science Building’s walkway and seating area. And in 1982, it contributed $1,000 for the yarn sculpture on the library’s second floor.",
