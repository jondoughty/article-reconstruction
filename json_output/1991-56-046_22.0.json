    "article_text": "In the euphoria of the referendum decision. Cal Poly athletics received more good news. Both the men’s and women’s swimming teams are ranked No. 3 in Division II by a preseason top-10 poll of the College Swim Coaches Association of America. The ranking is the highest Poly’s swim teams have ever had, said Cal Poly’s Head Coach Rich Firman. Firman accounts this largely to a g(x>d share of returning memlx'rs and new recruits despite the “uneasy” times before the referendum decision. “We’ve got a lot of returning juniors and sophomores and, surprisingly, with the referendum, we had a good recruiting year,” Firman said. “We have a transfer who is a U.S. Open qualifier in the 50-meter freestyle, and we drew in two high sch(X)l All-Amer*ican recruits.” Firrnan said they have a returning team that placed second in the nationals’ 800-meter free relay. He said one of the returning students, swim team captain Jeremy Brannon, placed in the U.S. Open. The team also has returning national champion swim team captain Stephanie Keller. Keller, a liberal studies junior, is in her third year on the team. She was pleased with the recent polls and sized up this year as having a “solid team with a lot of good people on it.” “I’m really happy about it,” Keller said. “It makes the team motivated to see that we’re ranked and people notice us.” Team captain and physical education junior P.J. Madigan is in his third year on the men’s team. He said he felt last year’s performance in the national championship, particularly some fast relays, helped them to get the No. 3 rating. “I was surprised. I expected us to be up there, but I thought UC Davis would be ahead of us,” said Madigan. “It really gives us something to shoot for.” Team captain and reci'eation administration junior Anne Oberg was also surprised with the ranking, released Nov. 25. “All along I’ve been told that this year’s team is the best we’ve ever had, but it was hard to see that because of the referendum,” Oberg said. Oberg said the referendum kept many good people from competing in the meets. She explained that if people swam in one meet and the referendum did not pass, they would lose their eligibility. The team has competed in meets against Fresno State, University of Pacific, the Claremont Colleges and a relay meet in Bakersfield. So far, they have had only one meet where the entire team has competed. Firman said this has kept the team from reaching “full strength” in the meets. “Now that we know we’re going to have a team, things are going pretty well and everyone’s motivated,” Keller said. “I think that the referendum decision has made us better. We really had to work as a team to get people to vote and that really brought us together.” FiiTnan expressed excitement about the polls but said they are still subject to change throughout the year. He felt confident the polls will be a g(X)d indicator of the final places at the national championship meeting scheduled in March. Finnan said the highest the team has ever been in the Division II nationals occurred when the women team placed fifth and the men placed eighth. Last year, the women placed seventh and the men placed 10th.",
