    "article_text": "Water sinks Strange, German wins AUGUSTA. Ga. (AP) - West German Bernhard Langer, taking full advantage of ’Curtis / Strange's watery disasters Sunday, fired a 4-under-par 68 in the ck'sing round and became only the third foreign player to win the prestigious Masters golf .tournament. , linger, the first German to win any of golf’s four major championships, acquired his first American triumph by a two-stroke margin with a 282 total. 6-under-par on the Augusta National Golf Club course that was da;npened by an occasional drizzle. • l^anger, four shots back with nine holes to play in the chase for the famed green jacket that goes to the winner, used the two par-5’s on the back nine, the 13th and 15th, as the keys to his triumph. Langer birdied both, reaching the putting surface in two and 2-putting on each. Strange, who hadn’t even expected to play here, opened the tournament with an 80 and bogeyed both those holes.He hit into Rae’s Creek on the 13th and took two shots to get out of the little stream trickling along in a' rocky ravine. On the 15th, Strange looked up in disbelief when his second shot found the pond in front of the green. It sent the leading money winner for the year on the PGA tour reeling back into the pack and paved the. way for the curly-haired Langer, 27, to join South African Gary Player and the current British Open champion, Seve Ballesteros of Spain, as the only foreign winners of the tournament that ranks with the U.S. and British Opens and the PGA as the game’s Big Four. Strange, the winner of two Tour events already this season. finished with u 71 and was tied for second at 284 with Ballesteros and third-round leader Ray Floyd. Ballesteros shot 70 and Floyd matched par-72. Jay Haas, once Strange's roommate at Wake Forest, was next at 67-285. Jack Nicklaus, vainly seeking an expansion of his record collection of 17 major professional titles, was tied at 286 with Craig Stadler, Bruce Lietzke and Gary Hallberg. Hallberg, who has taken to wearing an Indiana Jones fedora hat, managed a 70 despite af bail in the water and a double bdgey on the par-3 12th. Stadler, a former winner here, and Lietzke, a cross-handed putter, also had 70s.",
