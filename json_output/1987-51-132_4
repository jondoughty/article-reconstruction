    "article_text": "The times they are a-changin\u2019. In 1982 I left a good job at Marineland to come to Cal Poly. At the time KMET was my favorite radio station, we used punch cards in computer classes and Mustang Daily was put together on manual typewriters. All that\u2019s changed. Marineland and KMET are gone, while the journalism and computer science departments have entered the 20th century. For better or worse, change is inevitable, except when the invisible hand of bureaucracy gets a grip on an idea and holds onto it long after it has outlived its usefulness. The General Education and Breadth requirements, that bouillabaisse of classes that dominates our college experience, is one idea that has gone awry, destroying students\u2019 enthusiasm and replacing it with boredom. There is an old saying that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. But when the subject is philospophy, psychology or the life sciences, a little knowledge is a useless thing. Introductory classes are geared toward preparing students for further studies in the field. But with numerous GE requirements to fulfill, one class may be the only exposure to a subject students get. Most of what is covered is quickly forgotten, and anything retained is only useful when working crossword puzzles and watching \u201cJeopardy.\u201d The \u201ctake this class, take that class\u201d approach is defended by some who feel it encourages students to examine their options. But at Cal Poly, changing majors is discouraged. The theory at this university is a) know what you want to do before you get here, and b) do that. With these two conflicting approaches \u2014 opening students to a subject and then denying them the opportunity to pursue it fur- ther \u2014 students have become frustrated and disinterested. Even administrators know most GE classes are throwaways. With a wink and a nod, they allov/ us to take the classes credit/no credit so the grades won\u2019t affect GPAs. Teachers, with a wink and a nod, grade on attendance and rote memorization. And students play \u201ccram \u2019n\u2019 forget.\u201d All this winking and nodding makes me dizzy and nauseated. It\u2019s not that I mind easy classes, but if I\u2019m going to waste my time. I\u2019d rather do it with a beer in hand and a Dodger game on the TV. An example of my point lies in the computer science requirement many students face. They get 10 weeks of writing programs in BASIC. But teaching programming to non-technical majors is like starting a driver\u2019s training class with a detailed analysis of carburetors. The school systematically instills computer phobia instead of teaching how to choose a good computer and how a computer can help in everyday life. The misdirected efforts can be seen in the library\u2019s computer room on any night: students cursing, crying and requesting help from anyone with an air of confidence. Every computer science student knows how pathetic the situation is, but that hasn\u2019t brought change. To rectify the situation, two steps must be taken. First, departments must renovate GE classes so they are interesting to the masses \u2014 light on theory and memorization and heavy on practical use. Second, and more importantly, students should be given more control of their curriculum and a chance to build an enjoyable and useful schedule. After all, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to choose something easier than Biology 101.",
