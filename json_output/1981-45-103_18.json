    "article_text": "The man who holds the position of Secretary of the Interior is'charged with both the preservation and development of public lands—roughly one-fifth of all the land in the United ' States, or more than four hundred million acres, most of it in the West and Alaska. He administers mining leases, decides the fate of one billion acres on the outer continental shelf, manages 300 national parks and is charged with preserving endangered species. Such a man should hold the environment, the natural beauty of our national heritage, above short-term profit and out of the reach of those sections of private industry that have no concept of the value of life, of health, of the true glories of our earth.\t^ Secretary of the Interior James Watt has proven time and again he lacks the empathy with nature to hold this position. Since his appointment, he has: —halted expenditure of funds for the acquisition of land for national parks, including parks whose purchase Congress has already authorized. —fired the entire professional staff of the Council on Environmental Quality, whose function is to see that federal agencies carry out the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. —plans to open up 100 million acres of federal land in Alaska for oil and gas leases by the end of the year,' despite the lack of time to do federally mandated environmental studies. —has opened up sections of the California coast for oil and ' gàs drilling while ignoring the state's recommendations and pushing aside federal laws protecting rafé species such drilling would endang^^'‘He has also hinted he will allow drilling in marine sanctuaries. —proposes to make it easier for companies to strip mine without facing the cost of reclaiming the area. —proposes to legalize “denning\": going into coyote dens and clubbing the cubs to death.\t' —backs weakening of air- and water-pollution contrpls. —backs weakening of laws forbidding the hunting and importing of rare species. The people Walt has chosen and endorsed to surround him in Washington damn him as much as his actions: — Anne Gorsuch, radically pro-development, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. —William Coldiron, former general counsel of the Montana Power Co., as solicitor of the Interior Department. —John Crowell as head,of the Forest Department, the largest public-land manager outside Interior. Crowell is a former lobbyist for one of the country’s largest timber cutters and has frequently denounced the Forest Service and its goal of setting aside forests for wilderness areas. Actions are usually louder than words, but Watt’s words , sufficiently condemn him: We have already protected most of the truly unique lands.\t^ I will err on the side of public versus preservation.” What is the real motive of the extreme environmentalists who appear to be determined to accomplish their objective at whatever cost to society? Is it to simply protect the environment? Is it to delay and deny energy development? Is it to weaken America?” We will use the budget system to be the excuse to make majSr policy decisions.” I’m out to make decisions and I will make them quickly...! make lots of mistakes 'cause I make a lot of decisions.” “No other Secretary of the Interior, in recent times at least, has had a president who understands my department like Ronald Reagan does...When I said, ‘I want to do this, I want to do that,’ he replied, ’Sic ’em.’ ” We must inventory the land and it doesn’t matter if it's covered with trees, grass or water.” We have institutionalized the environmental movement. We have done a good job of that, so these preservationist groups have got to preserve themselves. They must look for a cause.” Anyone who thinks environmentalists must actually search out a cause to fìght for, as if there aren’t enough thrown in their faces, clearly should not be Interior Secretary. Moves are underway to get him dismissed by Congress, and petitions are circulating to that effect. Sign one, circulate a few—they are available at ECO—SLO, 985 Palm St., San Luis Obispo. Watt was in his niche as advisor for the pro-development Mountain States Legal Foundation. Help him find his home, his place in society—send him packing from the Interior Department.",
