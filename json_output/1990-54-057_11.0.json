    "article_text": "The men’s basketball team lost two games this weekend, ending its three-game CCAA winning streak. Playing their first league game away from Mott Gym, the Mustangs fell to Chapman College 86-76 on Friday night. Coach Steve Beason said the Mustangs led by one point with about 2:00 left in the game when Chapman’s Beau Pack hit a three-point shot. Then Mustang point guard Simon Thomas intentionally fouled Chapman’s Von Shuler as he scored on a breakaway layup. Shuler hit both free throws, and suddenly the Mustangs were down by six, and Chapman took it from there. The Mustangs committed 15 turnovers in the game. “We were playing a quicker team,” Beason said, “and we made some poor decisions on passes. We were a little bit careless.” Stuart Thomas scored a game-high 27 points and grabbed nine rebounds for the Mustangs. On Saturday, the Mustangs lost to to Cal State Dominguez Hills 58-56. Beason said his team’s play improved from Friday night, but it wasn’t enough. “Dominguez played a super game,” Beason said. Coby Naess led the Mustangs with 18 points, while Cal State Dominguez Hills’ Raymond Bennett scored a game-high 26 points. The Mustangs are now 13-6 overall, 3-3 in the CCAA. The Mustangs have eight games remaining in the CCAA regular season — three at home and five away. “It’s an uphill fight from now on,” Beason said.",
