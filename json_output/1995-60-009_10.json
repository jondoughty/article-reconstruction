    "article_text": "real issues. With all the cross coverage of ev«y an^e of the trial, the real issue of whether OJ, Simpson actually did kill his ex-wife and her friend are lost in the shuffle. People need to look at this former footbadl star and decide if he committed two murders. The othwr issues are I could hear the roars of ii\\justice from men and women\t“ bf coran^tt^ two murders, ^e othwr alike at what they would call orotectiiur abusive men and\t• «»trfction from his gmlt or innocence. •like at what they would call protecting iJiusive men and ignoring women’s rights. All I can say to the cries of inequality and outright claims of prejudice is this: Get a grip. This trial has been completely blown out of proportion. But this distraction was an ingenious move by the defense. After all, Simpson is a free man, regardless of his race or wife-beater status. I cannot speak for all people who do not follow a religion, jiut as I understand Johnson doesn’t speak for all those who do, but the question of whether there is a divins power is not what makes someone an atheist. It is the loss of faith in the institutions that forces it upon us. A god is something more than the founder of right and wrong or good and bad, he is a faith that carries one through life. I choose to follow my own faith than that of someone who existed 2,000 years ago. It saddens me to hear someone speak like Johnson did became he is missing the point of his own god, and transforming his S3rmbd of good into a rule book. “Everything we do (and don’t do) is based on a belief in God,” Johnson said. I hope someday he can leam to do something for himself.",
