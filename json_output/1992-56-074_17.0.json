    "article_text": "To call Meg Mitchell, the lone senior on the Mustangs’ 12-member squad, an intense basketball player would be an understatement. From the opening tipoff, Mitchell pounds the boards with authority. She leaps into the air for every missed shot. And during a fast break, she is often the first person to the other end of the floor, running the sideline and shouting encouragement to her teammates. Some might say that this sort of performance is to be expected from every player on the floor. However, Mitchell, a 22-year-old speech communications major, doesn’t let the fact that she may not be on the floor dampen her enthusiasm. Many of the aforementioned antics take place while she is sitting the bench. “Meg has emerged as our leader,” said Cal Poly Head Coach Jill Orrock of Mitchell’s role on the team. “What she does for the team I haven’t seen anyone else do. She’s the heart and soul of this team.” Mitchell’s contributions to the Mustangs’ play have become more evident as the season progresses, culminating in a 16-point, 10-rebound performance against Chapman last Friday. Her biggest asset to the team is not her scoring, however, but rather what she describes as her emotional leadership. “I’ve always been competitive,” she said. “Scoring has never been a big thing for me. That’s one of the things I pride myself on is that even if I can’t score. I’ll do my best to bust my butt on every other aspect of the game.” Mitchell said her all-out style of play stems partially from this being her last year of eligibility. Playing at this intensity is a given, she said, because there is really nothing to lose. “I’ll give anything and everything to win,” she said of her on-court performance. “I think that’s how people should play because you never know when your last game is going to be.” Mitchell’s expectations of maximum effort include herself, Orrock said. “She leads by example,” Orrock said. “I expect her to keep the team up emotionally, and that’s a hard thing to do. “When she’s not in practice, there’s a lull — it’s almost irritating at times.” Mitchell’s role on the team increased dramatically when she stepped into a starting position replacing junior forward Kristie McCall, whose season ended abruptly after a knee injury in late January. Mitchell adapted quickly to the challenge and is one of the key reasons the Mustangs are 3-1 over the last two weekends. Mitchell and her teammates could win a spot in the league championships this weekend when they travel to Cal State San Bernardino on Friday and Cal State Dominguez Hills on Saturday. Cal Poly (14-10 overall) is third in the conference with a 5-5 league record. “Ever since high school it’s been a situation where somebody has told me I can’t do it,” Mitchell said of her various play- ing experiences, which include stints at Costa Mesa High Sch(x)l, (Jolden West Community College and the University of Arizona. “So I immediately go out and try to do it.” As a senior and a co-captain, Mitchell sees her role as something slightly more than just another player when relating to teammates. “Some people have a hard time talking to the coaches, so it’s kind of easier to go talk to one of your own players,” she said. Sometimes, Mitchell admits, her enthusiasm prompts her to do the talking. “I find myself coaching the girls sometimes when I’m out there (on the floor), and I have to stop myself and say, ‘Hey, this isn’t your job,”’ she said. “They understand that if they’re not doing the job. I’ll be the first to tell them.”",
