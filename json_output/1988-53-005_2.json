    "article_text": "About 20 members of the Young Democrats turned out at Osos Street’s Rose and Crown while the College Republicans gathered in the University Union lounge to cheer their respective candidates in last night’s presidential debate. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Vice President George Bush faced off in the televised debate Sunday night. “We’re very serious ... about knowing what’s going on,’’ said Shara Peters, Young Democrats president and cofounder. The Democratic Central Committee of San Luis Obispo sponsored the event at Rose and Crown to “make people aware of the issues,’’ said Tom Ferraro, president of the DCC. The mostly partisan crowd watched the screen closely, though the waitresses were kept running by a few who seemed to have come chiefly for the beer and food. Applause for Dukakis broke out early as he lambasted Bush’s participation in the Reagan administration’s dealings with Panamanian President’Manuel Noriega. Bush’s rebuttal that the CIA could find no proof of Noriega’s wrongdoing was met with scattered grumblings and hisses. As a result, Ferraro said, “Bush never quite recover^. I think Dukakis rattled Bush. Dukakis came across as more of a leader.’’ Cal Poly student Brendan Martin agreed. “Bush seemed to stumble ... teemed unorganized,’’ he said. Martin said Bush, however, did seem “better at off-the-cuff remarks.’’ The College Republicans reserved the television lounge in the University Union for viewing the debate, according to president Andrea Mundorf. The Republican Party of San Luis Obispo County did not sponsor any special events; volunteer Gary Kunkel said there were possibly some private parties planned. Richard Kranzdorf, political science professor and adviser to the Young Democrats, said there were “no major gaffes.’’ Members of the Young Democrats saw Sec DEBATE, back page the debate more in Dukakis’ favor. Member Stephanie Ball said Dukakis did a good job covering such issues as the homeless, defense spending and the concerns of the middle class. Other viewers remained confused with the outcome. Halfway through the debate, Eric Linxwiler, a senior speech communications/political science major, said disgustedly, “(Dukakis) comes out with these cute one-liners and everyone claps. “(The audience) was indirectly led to support Dukakis” because “obviously the panel was leaning toward Dukakis,” he said. Organizers and participants were pleased with the 73 to l(X) viewers who attended the debate at Roae and Crown.",
