    "article_text": "Santa Barbara businessman Michael Huffington announced his congressional candidacy Wednesday at the San Luis Obispo Courthouse. Santa Barbara businessman Michael Huffington announced Wednesday that he is running for the new District 22 congressional seat, giving voters “a choice between status quo and change.” Huffington will be running against fellow Republican Rep. Robert Lagomarsino for the new seat, which covers Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. After making his announcement on the San Luis Obispo Courthouse steps, Huffington, who has never run for office, said he wants to help bring about a “new national order.” Citing a system that he said was pushing people onto welfare and into crime, Huffington said the country is in a mess that only can be changed with a different group of people in Congress. “We need people different from the ones who have sat in Congress decade after decade, until they have forgotten why they went there in the first place,” Huffington said. Huffington, who said he supports term limits, called the present Congress a club, “and the armchairs of the club are deep and comfortable. “The only way we’re going to get rules that are fair is to change the players,” Huffington added. Huffington, who is considered a moderate Republican, called himself a “conservative with a conscience.” “I believe in lower taxes and fiscal responsibility,” he said. “I also believe in help for those who truly need it.” Huffington also said he is pro-choice on the question of abortion. Huffington said he and his wife are personally opposed to abortion, but “we also believe very strongly in every woman’s right to :h(X)se and in the freedom to keep life’s private decisions private.” James Lindholm, a Cal Poly political science graduate, said he found some of the things Huffington said interesting. Let’s have some fun today by talking about car alarms and, specifically, how exactly we should torture those who own them. Quid pro quo, dear readers. For years on end, car alarm owners have been waking us up morning, noon and night, selfishly stealing the serenity of a good b<K)k, compact disc or simple peace and quiet. Whenever the world seems too much, the car alarm’s whining mating call is the final straw that sends us teetering onto the edge of insanity. “Wee-uh wee-uh wee-uh,” it says. we say back. Finally, after years of complacency and suffering, the Andy Rooney side of me is fed up. It’s time to take action. First, a brief history, as this invasion of car alarms is not a new phenomenon. My earliest memories of them go back to a “TJ. Hooker” episode in which Romano (Adrian Zmed) bought a snazzy sports car equipped with all the latest gadgets. He was then able to gain the adoration of several Heather Locklear stunt doubles by standing 20 feet away from the car outside a nightclub and, with one beep-beep of his key ring gizmo, putting a near-kryp-tonite shield around it. Sneezing five blocks away set off something similar to the Diablo Canyon sirens, which kept Romano’s car plenty safe while he was inside catching Dance Fever and, presumably, a host of other diseases. That was 1983, and since, car alarms — as well as Adrian Zmed — have both outlived their usefulness. Instead of alerting us to a possible theft in progress, car alarms most often do nothing more than hurt our ears. What do we say when we hear rorne-one’s alarm going off.^ “Uh-oh! I’d better rush to the police and report this!” Perhaps. Nope. “There goes someone’s stupid car alarm again,” THAT’S what we say. So how do we rid the planet of these things? Fear not. While it is improbable lawmakers will soon ban these devices, there are a few handy things you, the reader, can do to indirectly shut these things up. “Pam,” suggested an acquaintance on Tuesday, referring to that fun all-purpose kitchen spray. “Put it on their windshield. It’ll come off with some soap and water.” I’m starting to feel better already, ni even do my part now by providing a paragraph you can stick into the windshield wiper: On behalf of everyone within a three-mile radius, I have temporarily defaced your windshield with a nonstick kitchen spray commonly used for eggs and muffins. It can be removed with soap, water and a bit of elbow grease. This will happen again and again until your car alarm has ceased to disrupt the natural beauty of the Central Coast. Undoubtedly, a few of you will give this a quick read and take to putting SPAM on windshields of yelping cars. This is also acceptable. Both are certainly a shade less harmful than the ’ol tator-in-the-tailplpe trick. It may sound cruel now, but let’s see how you feel the next time someone’s alarm trips off at 3 a.m. There are more diplomatic means to pursue, I guess. How about a separate lot for alarm-equipped cars on campus located further into the hills behind the sheep unit? Or maybe little plastic window triangles that say “Car alarm on board” so we’ll know which cars to spray. Car alarms and plastic window triangles may be a dangerous combination, though. What if they were to breed? They are still uncertain exactly who they will be able to speak with, Granato said,' because it has been difficult to get appointments. With so many students there to lobby at once, many legislators are Ixxiked. “I think that once we’re there we can sit in with other schools,” she said. Granato said she plans to voice “student concerns about increasing fees and declining services, like our library.” “I want to ask how are students supposed to deal with this, what role can they play?” she said. Granato and Joynt will also attend Monday’s rally and press conference. This will be a joint rally with students from both the eSU and the University of California systems. The UC counterpart to CSSA, the University of California Student Association, is holding its own legislative conference in Sacramento this weekend. During the rally, the chairs of both student associations will be speaking on the “State of the Student,” relating the effects of three years of fee increases and cuts in classes and services. Legislative speakers are also scheduled to participate in the rally and press conference. More than 500 students are expected to attend Monday’s events, said Jeff Chang, CSSA legislative director. “We think it is going to be a very good experience,” he said. Conference seminars that Granato, Joynt and other participants will be attending include budget strategy sessions, which are meant to organize and set goals for each campus, Chang said. It will also be a time for campuses to encourage others and to network for joint planning, he said. On the second day of the conference, a budget panel will present the budget from the viewpoint of the state, the CSU and the students. “Basically, we’re giving the specifics on the budget,” Chang said. Before meeting with legislators on Monday, the participants will receive training on how to lobby. Staff members from the Capitol, including the governor’s office, will give tips and pointers on what to do when meeting with the legislators, Chang said. “We’re looking at it as one of the high points of the weekend,” he said. CSSA will also be presenting and explaining five pieces of legislation they are supporting. The bill which will have the most direct effect on student fees is one which will enforce the current law forbidding fees to increase more than 10 percent a year. “We definitely want to get that one passed,” Chang said. “We want to send a message to the trustees (that) you can raise fees, but you will have a fight.” Also being considered is a bill which would place the CSU mission statement into law. Tliis statement, which states that the CSU is primarily a teaching university and that it will accept the top one-third of California high school graduates, is understood but has never been made law, Chang said. This leaves it open for violations, such as enrollment cuts, he said. Although Cal Poly is not a voting member of CSSA, the school may still send representatives to conferences such as this, Granato said. Part of her mission this weekend will be to evaluate CSSA’s benefits to decide if Cal Poly may want to later pay dues to gain voting privileges, she said.",
