    "article_text": "The next round of student action against the CSlTs proposed 40 percent fee increase will take place this weekend when the California State Student Association (CSSA) holds its 14th Annual Legislative Conference in Sacramento. The conference will bring stu- dent representatives from every campus in the CSU system together for a weekend of seminars on the budget and lobbying tactics. It will culminate in a rally Monday afternoon on the steps of the Capitol. Students will also spend Monday practicing what they have learned by meeting with and lobbying legislators. Cal Poly’s student views will be voiced by representatives ASI administrative coordinator Laura Granato and ASI executive assistant Gabe Joynt. Granato and Joynt will be participating in the budget and lobbying seminars and will meet with legislators Monday. They are still uncertain exactly who they will be able to speak with, Granato said,' because it has been difficult to get appointments. With so many students there to lobby at once, many legislators are Ixxiked. “I think that once we’re there we can sit in with other schools,” she said. Granato said she plans to voice “student concerns about increasing fees and declining services, like our library.” “I want to ask how are students supposed to deal with this, what role can they play?” she said. Granato and Joynt will also attend Monday’s rally and press conference. This will be a joint rally with students from both the eSU and the University of California systems. The UC counterpart to CSSA, the University of California Student Association, is holding its own legislative conference in Sacramento this weekend. During the rally, the chairs of both student associations will be speaking on the “State of the Student,” relating the effects of three years of fee increases and cuts in classes and services. Legislative speakers are also scheduled to participate in the rally and press conference. More than 500 students are expected to attend Monday’s events, said Jeff Chang, CSSA legislative director. “We think it is going to be a very good experience,” he said. Conference seminars that Granato, Joynt and other participants will be attending include budget strategy sessions, which are meant to organize and set goals for each campus, Chang said. It will also be a time for campuses to encourage others and to network for joint planning, he said. On the second day of the conference, a budget panel will present the budget from the viewpoint of the state, the CSU and the students. “Basically, we’re giving the specifics on the budget,” Chang said. Before meeting with legislators on Monday, the participants will receive training on how to lobby. Staff members from the Capitol, including the governor’s office, will give tips and pointers on what to do when meeting with the legislators, Chang said. “We’re looking at it as one of the high points of the weekend,” he said. CSSA will also be presenting and explaining five pieces of legislation they are supporting. The bill which will have the most direct effect on student fees is one which will enforce the current law forbidding fees to increase more than 10 percent a year. “We definitely want to get that one passed,” Chang said. “We want to send a message to the trustees (that) you can raise fees, but you will have a fight.” Also being considered is a bill which would place the CSU mission statement into law. Tliis statement, which states that the CSU is primarily a teaching university and that it will accept the top one-third of California high school graduates, is understood but has never been made law, Chang said. This leaves it open for violations, such as enrollment cuts, he said. The other three bills — concerning paying fees by credit card, removing the student union fee cap and commissioning a study on the relationship between higher education and the California economy — have yet to find authors in the Legislature. Although Cal Poly is not a voting member of CSSA, the school may still send representatives to conferences such as this, Granato said. Part of her mission this weekend will be to evaluate CSSA’s benefits to decide if Cal Poly may want to later pay dues to gain voting privileges, she said.",
