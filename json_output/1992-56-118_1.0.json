    "article_text": "Hillary Rodham Clinton told an audience of about 100 supporters at Vista Grande restaurant Friday to think about their future and the future of their children when they vote in this year’s elections. In her speech, she briefly outlined the political platform of her husband Bill Clinton, a Democratic presidential candidate. Clinton said her husband will implement a new economic system which will put people ahead of money. He will support investor tax credit to allow businesses to install new equipment in the workplace and to produce new jobs. He will eliminate tax advantages that reward those who pick up and move their business out of the country. Moreover, he will emphasize job training in order to help workers gain skills to demand and exceed wages that others demand in other countries. The education plan described drew applause. Clinton’s husband wants to develop a strategy and partnership with educators to achieve national education goals, which Clinton said have been “placed on a shelf by the Bush administration.” C^e goal is to place Americans at the top of the world in math and science by the year 2000. Clinton’s education plan also includes providing loans to those needing assistance which can be paid back through community service. Serving as a police officer, a teacher’s assistant or child care worker would serve as repayment. In addition, Clinton’s husband wants to establish an apprenticeship program in high schools for kids to improve their marketability if they choose not to attend college. “We don’t really take advantage of the good, hardworking young people who we have,” Clinton said as she gripped the podium. “We could help (them) become much better skilled through the national apprenticeship program for anyone who wants to understand the value of work and be a real contributor. “We believe that the education of a future generation of America is not only good for them but essential to our country and its See CLINTON, page 8 From page 1 growth.” Another essential issue Clinton said her husband shows eagerness to take on is health care, an issue he would pay immediate attention to should he be elected. His plans for improving health care include steps such as controlling costs, reforming insurance practices and providing better access for primary and preventive health care. “We are so penny-wise and dollar-foolish when it comes to our health care system in this country,” Clinton said. Clinton said prenatal care, which costs up to $1,000, should be given to every American woman. This would save from having to pay as much as $150,000 to keep babies alive that were bom to women who went without prenatal care. In concluding the overview of her husband’s platform, she noted two issues that apply specifically to California. She told the audience that her husband wants everyone to view economic development and environmental protection as mutual support goals, not competing goals. Energy conservation was the other issue which she said she feels is important to this state. Natural gas should be used more, and more research should be conducted to find new methods of using fuel. She then told the audience she hopes that those who support this campaign support Clinton for the reasons he is in this race. “I think what America needs now is a leader who will say to all of us, Tes, we’ve got some rough times in front of us,’ ” Clinton said. “An-yone who watched the television last week knows v/e have deep and profound problems, but -you know, we have a real opportunity as well. That opportunity is to demonstrate that we’re not only problem-solvers, but we are builders. We are people who want to build a new vision. “Ultimately, what we have to do is reach across the cynicism, the negativism and the despair that people in all walks of life are feeling in America today. “We have to get people to believe again that we can make a difference. If we carry that message, there is no doubt in my mind, we will not only have a new president, we will have a new beginning that can give America some of its greatest days it has ever had,” she said before receiving a standing ovation. • Clinton said she would have told students the same thing as she told the fund-raiser audience if time would have allowed for her to address the students. “I think the message of economic hope and employment and education opportunity is a message not just for young people,” Clinton said in between shaking hands after her speech. “It is a message for all Americans.” Robert Koob, vice president of Academic Affairs, said Cal Poly was fortunate to have Clinton on campus because it will bring attention to the campus and the community, and it shows they count. Koob said he attended the fund-raiser to show general support for the election process, and to try and represent the university in national politics. Kristin Burnett, ASI president-elect, also attended the fund-raiser. “This is an excellent opportunity to share with students my perception of what a presidential campaign looks like,” she said. Burnett hopes Clinton will take student ideas back to Arkansas. Bill Clinton is governor of Arkansas. Immediately after her speech, Hillary Clinton was rushed off so she could keep on her schedule. Prom San Luis Obispo she went to South Central Los Angeles and spoke to community leaders. From L.A. she went to Sacramento, and from Sacramento she went to San Francisco in a single day. Alec Kohut, a member of Young Democrats at Cal Poly, said the students should not feel snubbed by Clinton because she did not speak with them. “I am into politics, and I understand her schedule,” Kohut said. “You don’t see Barbara Bush coming near SLO. At least it’s on (Clinton’s) mind.”",
