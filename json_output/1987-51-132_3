    "article_text": "Tipsy Taxi is soliciting funds from clubs and community organizations after receiving $2,000 of the $2,500 requested under the 1987-1988 ASI budget. Coordinator Franklin Burris said the program needed $2,700 from ASI but only asked for $2,500, so is now looking for an additional $700. Poly Phase has already donated $100 to the Tipsy Taxi program. Dave Benham, a member of Poly Phase and also a senator from the School of Engineering, suggested that his club make the donation. Benham said Poly Phase thinks it is important to discourage drunk driving and to improve student/ community relations. Benham said he hopes to make a statement to other clubs that Greek organizations shouldn\u2019t have to carry the burden of community relations. Benham also sees the donation to Tipsy Taxi as a thanks to the patrons of the Poly Phase book exchange. Burris said he wants to get funding from clubs as well as from fraternities and sororities. Walt Lambert, coordinator of Greek Affairs, said, \u201cI try to en-See TAXI, back page dorse that type of thing heavily. If it saves one guy\u2019s life, it\u2019s worth it.\u2019\u2019 Though Lambert endorses Tipsy Taxi, he said, \u201c1 unfortunately think the whole program is a preventative maintenance type program.\u2019\u2019 He said students tend not to use preventative maintenance until it is too late and then wish they had it. Lambert said he hopes the Tipsy Taxi coupon books will be kept at fraternity and sorority houses to be used when necessary. He said that even though sororities don\u2019t have parties at their houses, they should purchase coupon books to take to parties. One fraternity involved with Tipsy Taxi is Phi Delta Theta. President Steve Hall said besides buying coupon books, the fraternity will work to raise $500 for the program in 1987-1988. Hall strongly urges other fraternities to support the Tipsy Taxi program to prove themselves responsible hosts. Burris would like to get additional funding from local bars. Some of the bars do not even buy the coupon books, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to work with them,\u2019\u2019 Burris said. Osos Street Subs and Tortilla Flats have bought coupon books. So has McLintock\u2019s Saloon, whose owner John Bushnell is president of the Business Improvement Association. Champions and Rose and Crown pub have tbeir own taxi programs. Bob Speicher, owner of Spike\u2019s Place, said he would rather regulate from within. \u201cWe police ourselves pretty well,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have (people driving home drunk) here that much.\u2019\u2019 He said people usually go to places other than Spike\u2019s to get drunk. \u201cThe basics of the (Tipsy Taxi) program are OK, but it seems like a Band-Aid type of thing,\u2019\u2019 Speicher said. The recently reopened Graduate would like to get involved in the Tipsy Taxi program, said general manager Charles DeGroot. Currently, the Graduate will get a taxi for someone who refuses to pay for a cab but is too drunk to drive. Bull\u2019s Tavern doesn\u2019t pay for the cab, but they will take a drunk customer\u2019s car keys away and call a cab for him, said bartender Joe Eifter. In addition to contacting Greeks and local bars for sup- port. Tipsy Taxi gave a presentation to the Chamber of Commerce last week. Bill Morem at the Chamber of Commerce said, \u201cOur chamber board unanimously supported it as a concept.\u2019\u2019 However, it is not the rule of the chamber to lend financial support, he said. Burris will also look for support from the City Council, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the California Highway Patrol.",
