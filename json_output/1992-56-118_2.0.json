    "article_text": "A group protesting the phaseout of the home economics and engineering technology departments was on hand Friday to greet Hillary Clinton as she made her way into a benefit breakfast for her husband. A seasoned public figure and wife of Arkansas Governor and presidential hopeful Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton listened intently to the students. She mentioned the encounter in her speech at Vista Grande Restaurant. “I met today with the young people outside who were extraordinarily polite who said, ‘We are not protesting you, we are here protesting because of what is going to happen to our See PROTEST, page 7 education because of the cutbacks/ • she said. In her speech, Clinton explained how education has suffered because of the lack of funding for resources in addition to the increased amount of money allocated for non-educational services. “What Bill proposes doing is increasing that federal share (for education), back to what it was in 1980,” she said. Little did Clinton know these words of educational reform were broadcast over an audio system setup by a Cal Poly engineering technology student. Senior Jason Bradley, an employee of Cal Central Lighting and Sound, had arrived early Friday morning to prepare for the breakfast. “I brought in a bunch of equipment and then set it up,” Bradley said. “It’s great irony.” Inside the restaurant, honking car horns could be heard sporadically throughout the breakfast. John Luna, president of the American Society of Engineering Technologists and an ET senior, was pleased with the student support he has seen. “Every honk they (the administrators attending the breakfast) heard is an audible voice from us that says, Tley keep us in mind ... We are going to be a thorn in your side.’” Luna said. Close to 40 demonstrators lined the sidewalk to see Clinton on her way out. As she left, Clinton stopped briefly to speak with the demonstrators again and was given two T-shirts. Initially, Luna approached Clinton and presented her with an ET T-shirt. Then home economics major Kimberly McIn- tyre spoke briefly with Clinton and handed her a home ec T-shirt. Clinton responded to the students with gratitude and stressed the need for active voting to make a change. “It is just so important, not just for individual students but for a country, that we put education first and I hope that we can do that, but we cannot do it if people do not vote,” she said. During the breakfast, three ET majors sat inside, waiting for a chance to question Clinton on her husband’s educational goals. “Being that their campaign platform includes education ... we came today to voice our concerns about the changing education in the state of California,” said Gregory Thompson, an ET senior sitting inside the restaurant. But unfortunately, there wasn’t enough time. Moria Riorday, a graduating senior in ET, was able to speak with Clinton and presented her with an ET packet. It contained a personal letter, an ET fact sheet, a memo from the ET department head to Vice President for Academic Affairs Robert Koob outlining other options, a memo from the Engineering Council and clips from Mustang Daily. ASI President-elect Kristin Burnett was in attendance and complimented the ET and home ec students on an organized and effective showing. “I think that it (the demonstration) is both respectful and wise of them, because they are keeping it at the forefront of everybody’s attention,” she said. Neill Clark, a member of the ET faculty, was on hand to watch his students in action. “We’ve been demonstrating very vociferously,” he said. “Many of my students signed on this quarter to learn about electronics, but it turns out they are learning, I think, some far more important lessons.”",
