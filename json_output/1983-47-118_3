    "article_text": "With 5,000 gallons of milk and over 400 pounds of cheese being processed every week, the Cal Poly Dairy Processing Plant is certainly a busy little place. The plant is operated by 25 students, 23 are Dairy Manufacturing majors, and supervised by two foremen and one general manager. The plant handles all the Foundation\u2019s milk and byproducts, fills orders from Williams Brothers markets, and stocks the shelves of the campus store. The students work part-time between classes, and have weekends off. Their typical day begins t 6 a.m., but Mondays they must report to work by 4:30 a.m. \"By 2 o\u2019clock you are nodding off in your classes,\" according to Randall Dei, one of the foremen of the plant. Dei will be graduating next fall and has a job this summer working for Lucky\u2019s Fluid Milk Plant, but for now he spends most of his time helping to oversee operations of the Cal Poly plant. Monday, Wednesday and Friday the plant is in full operation processing fluid milk. \u201cAfter the milk comes down from the dairy it is stored in stainless steel tanks which hold 2,000 gallons of milk,\u201d Dei said. The milk is picked up from the dairy every other day. The milk is then drawn out of the tanks and standardized to 3.5 percent milkfat. \"To do this, cream is drawn off the top. Then the cream is used to make other things, like butter,\u201d Dei noted. \"The milk is pasteurized at 161 degrees for 15 seconds. From there it is put into the tiller which puts it into cartons or bags,\u201d Dei said. The plant also produces seven different kinds of cheme, which are sold in 20-pound blocks. A typical order from the cafeteria is 400 pounds of cheese per week. The cheese is also distributed to the campus store and Williams Brothers, where it is sold as Cal Poly cheese or generic brand. \u201cOur cheese is a higher quality than commercial brands because we cure it longer: we have more time,\u201d said Dei. First, a vat holding 1,000 gallons of milk is filled and cheese culture is added. This is left to ripen and rennett (an en-zymel is added to make the milk gel up. \"It gets to be the consistency of yogurt,\u201d Dei explained. \u201cThen this mixture is cut and cooked,\u201d he added. After this procedure the whey is drained off and cheese curd is left. \u201cThe cheese is vacuum sealed. This keps the air out\u00aband gives the product a longer shelf life,\u201d Dei said. Milk cheese is cured for three months, medium cheddar is cured four to six months, and sharp cheddar is cured six months. The curing rooms are huge walk-in coolers, their shelves stocked. All the products produced at the plant are product tested at the plant\u2019s own lab. \u201cEverything is state regulated, so you have to keep on top of it,\u201d Dei explained. \u201cEveryone who works here is pretty responsible, everyone pitches in,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are a pretty busy little place,\u201d said Dei. \u201cOur pricing must be comparable to that of commercial dairies, because we compete in the same market. \u201cWe have to rely on our name and quality.\u201d",
