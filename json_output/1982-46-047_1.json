    "article_text": "The function of pressure heaters and power-operated relief valves during an emergency at Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant topped the agenda at the first full-power testing license hearing Tuesday in Avila Beach. Among those representing Pacific Gas and Electric Company were members of the consulting team that has been working on the reverification program since the firm’s low-power testing license was suspended last November. During a discussion over operating procedure, project engineer John Houch said that in an emergency where the pressure heaters malfunctioned, the actions of the plant operator “would be committed to memory.” If the pressure heater malfunctioned, it would switch from automatic to manual control, Houch said. If the manual control effort proved unsuccessful, the operator would have to refer to the operating procedure manual and proceed to do a cold shutdown, he said. The pressure heaters are not classifîed under what PG&E calls \"safety grade” equipment. In behalf of the opposition, Herbert Brown, attorney for Gov. Edmund Brown Jr., asked why the pressure heaters are not of safety grade classification and what would be involved in “upgrading” them so they would be of safety grade status. ‘\"The cabling systems between the system’s pressure heaters would have to be upgraded to safety grade,” a PG&E spokesman said. “To upgrade them would require...considerable effort.” Equipment is labeled “safety grade” if its malfunction would cause an accident or if its function is instrumental in an emergency situation, according to PG&E definition\t. Pressure heaters are normal controling units and therefore would not be under a safety grade classification, he said. PG&E established in its testimony that a cold shutdown—when\tthe plant is closed completely—is possible without pressure heaters. The opposition later established that while there may be alternative methods of shutdown^ the current operating plan does not discuss any. In the discussion of the power-operated relief valves at Diablo Canyon, the inddsot involving valvee at *niree Mile Island was brought up by Joel Re3molds, public interest attorney. ‘T believe the valve opened but did not reclose (at Three Mile Island),\" Houch said. No member of the PG&E panel could verify whether the relief valve at lliree Mile Island was classified safety grade. ' It was established in testimony that the relief valve at Three Mile Island was not the only component that malfunctioned and that inap-prc^triate action taken by a pUmt operator escalated the acddient. Two of the three power-operated reliei valves at Diablo are safety grade, the other “in some respects is not,\" said Houch. If the valvee should stick open there is no way of manually closing them, Houch said. The valves were purchased\tfrom Westinghouse, according to Glenn Lange, Westinghouse engineer. The valvee were purchased in the early 1970's, he said. The governor’s at-tornqr asked if the valves were up to coda. Lange reqwnded, \"The valves met the standards and codes in effect at the time of purchase. Those codes may have changed.”",
