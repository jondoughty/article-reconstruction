    "article_text": "The function of pressure heaters and power-operated relief valves during an emergency at Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant topped the agenda at the first full-power testing license hearing Tuesday in Avila Beach. Among those representing Pacific Gas and Electric Company were members of the consulting team that has been working on the reverification program since the firm’s low-power testing license was suspended last November. During a discussion over operating procedure, project engineer John Houch said that in an emergency where the pressure heaters malfunctioned, the actions of the plant operator “would be committed to memory.” If the pressure heater malfunctioned, it would switch from automatic to manual control, Houch said. If the manual control effort proved unsuccessful, the operator would have to refer to the operating procedure manual and proceed to do a cold shutdown, he said. to Glenn Lange, Westinghouse engineer. The valvee were purchased in the early 1970's, he said. The governor’s at-tornqr asked if the valves were up to coda. Lange reqwnded, \"The valves met the standards and codes in effect at the time of purchase. Those codes may have changed.”",
