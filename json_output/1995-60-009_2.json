    "article_text": "Students crowded together in the San Lt^is Lounge as millions around the world anxiously awaited the O.J. Simpson verdict. By 9:20 a.m., 40 minutes before the jury was to read its verdict, dozens of students stared anxiously at the lounge’s large-screen television. On the screen, KTLA reporters discussed possible verdicts, crowd control and other issues surrounding the case. By 9:30 a.m., the flow into the lounge was at a dead stop. That is, no more people could fit. Those not lucky enough to grab a seat, stood or sat on tables and the floor. Some faces were anxious, others dimly attentive. Many had opinions about the case. “I think the verdict will probably be ‘not guilty,’ though it’s not my opinion that O.J. isn’t guilty,” said physical education senior lyier Wiggins. “I think money can basically buy freedom. It makes me question our judicial system. Two people got murdered — who’s going to pay for that?* While those ‘ in San Luis Lounge got caught up in the excitement of the trial, many Pbly students and staff seemed disgusted. “I think it doesn't matter because the media turned it into such a circus,” said architecture senior Mike Campos. “It’s all about ratings and making money.” Andrea Kerns, the department secretary for Student Life and Activities, shared the same view. “People get murdered every day,” she said. “I^ven firemen died the day this all happened; you didn’t hear about them. Those firemen ... matter.” Back in the lounge and minutes before the reading of the verdict, students and staff — disgusted and not — waited. One could hear the breaths of the people crowded in the lounge when the verdict was read — not guilty. Some in the lounge smiled, others frowned. Soon students and staff trailed out of the lounge. Some students, while they feel O.J. is guilty, said they expected he would be acquitted. ‘I thought he was guilty, but I knew he was going to walk,” said architectru*al engineering senior Ibm Lopez. ‘After listening to the Mark Fuhrman testimony, there was a lot of doubt.” ‘Money is a wonderful thing,” said physical education senior Kenny Craig. ”I kind of thought they would let him off.” Others said they were pleased with the verdict, believing the jury did its best with the evidence presented to them. Director of the Multicultural Center Everado Martinez-Inzun-za said he views the verdict as the judicial system going through its process. ”Having not had the opportunity to have sat through all of the trial and having listened to all the media, I ^1 Fm too biased to make a judgment call,” he said. “Twelve jurors sat through the whole thing and weighed out that evidence. Justice has been done.” ‘I’m kind of happy,” said engineering senior Leonard Pimen-til. “I believe the evidence found was too circumstantial. Hopefully people can realize the problem racism is in the LAPD and something will be done.” Others disagreed, however, and weren't as happy with the verdict “Who else would have killed them?” said engineering sophomore Doug Cox. “This is just an example of how the system fails.” There were mumbles from students about reverse racism and other references to racism within the LAPD. With few exceptions, people didn’t feel race had much to do with the verdict. ‘I’m not happy,” said business senior Patric ^gong. “I just think high-prohle celebrities tend to get off. It’s like they flash a gold card at the jury and they're off. Race doesn’t have anything to do with it.” Many students were more surprised that the verdict was reached so soon. ‘I was surprised it was ’not guilty* * as opposed to a hung jury,” said biochemistry senior Mike Flippin. *1 think more than anything the LAPD messed up what seemed to be an open and shut case.” Biology freshman Darcy Johnson summarized one feeling that most students, staff and many of tho;o involved the trial seem to have. *TYie media has publicized the trial so much,” she caid. “It’s just weird that it’s over.”",
