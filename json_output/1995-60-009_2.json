    "article_text": "from the three families whose lives were tom apart by the bloody June 12, 1994, slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. “Oh my God!” exclaimed Simpson’s grown daughter, Amelle, embracing her brother Jason. “We did it!” a family member exulted to lead defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. Eerily, the Simpson saga ended much as it had begun, with the fidlen football superstar being transported in a white van to OJ. Simpson clenches his Rsh in victory after the jury said on Tuesday he was not guilty in rders of his ax-wife Nicole Brown Sinr^sson and her friend Ronald Goldman / As- his estate while news helicopters tracked him overhead. Ibesday’s televised verdicts were the most-watched event since June 17,1994, when Simpson, in a white Bronco with his friend A1 “A.C.” Cowlings driving, led police on a surreal slow-speed chase viewed by millions. Cowlings was at the door to embrace Simpson when he arrived home about one hour after the verdicts were read. Later, family members gathered for a party on the lawn of Simpson’s lush estate. Florists, caterers and musicians pulled up to the house and told reporters surrounding the estate that they were there for a celebration. “Last June 13, *94 (the day he learned of his son’s death), was the worst nightmare of my life. This is the second,” Goldman’s father, Fred, said at a prosecution news conference. This prosecution team didn’t lose today. I deeply believe this country lost today. Justice was not served.” At a defense team news conference, Cochran insisted the issue of race, which he played heavily in the trial, did not overcome the facte. “This verdict speaks justice,” Cochran said. “This was a case based upon the See O J. page 2 O.J.: Cochran denies using race to sway jury,‘This verdict speaks justice.’ S.N.A.P.: cooperation of local landlords sought *We need absentee landlords to be more responsible,” Gardiner said. ”We really want to work with the property owners. But the issue is to get the disturbances to stop.” S.NA.P. member Ray FVigil-lana thinks the program is successful in stopping disturbances and in most cases people quiet down. *A lot of the people we talk to are real cooperative toward us,” FVigillana said. *We haven’t met much resistance.” Frigillana estimates that 90 percent of the noise disturbance calls are student-party related, and that SJ4A.P. has decreased police responses by about 50 percent. This gives police time to respond to more important calls. He denied playing ”the race card,” saying instead that credibility had won out. ‘Race plays a part in everything in America,” he said. \"But this stuff about playing a race card is preposterous.” The bitter differences that were known to be racking the defense team diiring the trial finally erupted after the verdict when defense attorney Robert Shapiro, original architect of the Simpson strategy, blasted two Dream Team colleagues. He said Cochran ii\\jected race as an issue over his objections. ”Not only did they play the race card, but we dealt it from the bottom of the deck,” he told Barbara Walters in an interview for ABC News. Shapiro, who is Jewish, also said he was deeply offended by Cochran’s comparison of a detective to Adolf Hitler and told Cochran so. He said he would not work with Cochran again and his longtime friendship with F. Lee Bailey was shattered by the case and they would never speak again. Cochran said he hoped the Los Angeles Police Department would alter shoddy investigative practices exposed in the trial. As the words setting Simpson free were spoken in court, his elderly mother, Eunice, seated in a wheelchair, wiped her eyes, held up her hands prayerfully and murmured words of thanks. *I was always in prayer. I knew my son was innocent,” she said at the defense meeting with reporters. Across the room, Goldman mouthed the word ‘murderer” as the verdict was announced. Kim Goldman, who spent most of a year in court honoring her dead brother’s memory, doubled over and sobbed along with a younger brother and sister. At the courthouse, Simpson’s older son, Jason, read a statement from his father: Dexter^s not his usual self. You suspect the salsa. So you call Dt, IWtiSblcitt, your family vet back home.",
