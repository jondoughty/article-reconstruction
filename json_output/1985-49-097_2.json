Hawkins told police that he awoke before the shooting started and heard voices across the creek \"They said Shut up or you'll wake those guys up.' \" Hawkins told police. Thinking it was some friends coming to visit. Hawkins lit a candle and then a flury of shots flew into the campsite, he said. Hawkins told police that he then yelled, \"I'll kill you I'll kill you \" In the reports, Rund told police that he thought he heard a gunshot aimed at them after Hawkins' shoutsawid they all hit the ground for cover. He said he thought they had stumbled onto some marijuana growers. The four men told police they thought they were under attack and waited there for about 90 minutes, until things quieted down They fired several shots before walking out of the canyon to let people know they were coming out. Rund told police Rey died from a 22 caliber bullet wound to the head Sixteen pellets from a 12-guage shotgun were also found in Rev's skull, reports said Rund told piolice that Nelson had a .22 rifle and Ryan had a .44-caliber pistol. Abolishing leftist governprients is the bottom line of the U.S. policy in Central America, a former New York Times reporter told a crowd of about 400 people Thursday night in Chumash Auditorium. Raymond Bonner, one of the first American journalists to report from behind the guerrilla lines in El Salvador, feels the United State's involvement in El Salvador is based on political ideologies. \"Forget about commercial economic interest or national security.” Bonner said. “W/e have no national reasons to go into El Salvador. The whole thing is based on ideology.\" Bonner's book. \"Weakness and Deceit — U.S. Policy in El Salvador, \" recently on the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, documenting the evolution of U.S. policy toward El Salvador. Bonner said the U.S. response to Nicaragua is to overthrow the Sandinistas, or have them \"cry uncle,\" Bonner said, quoting President Reagan in a recent press conference. Bonner described the U.S backed Contras as originally a band of misfits. \"The CIA took a rag-tag group of bandits and developied a very tough guerilla army, \" Bonner said. \"W'e've trainned them, given them equipment and even a manual in assassination.\" President Reagan called the Contras freedom fighters, but Bonner said he had some problems equating the Contras with America's founding fathers. \"1 don't recall the founding fathers raping and pillaging villages, slitting people's throats or having manuals to hire criminals to assassinate people.\" Bonner said there are many misconceptions regarding the Sandinista and Contra armies Stories of 100,000 Nicaraguan soldiers are false Bonner said. There are 40,000, which is 10,000 less than that of El Salvador. Other inaccuracies Bonner said, include the quality of weapons the Sandinistas are receiving, \"Tanks we're hearing about can't even make it up a small grade,\" Bonner said. \"And the Nicaraguan air force is a threat — to anyone that has to fly in their planes.\" In addition to the threat of Communism, Bonner said the United States is supporting El Salvador because America is told that Nicaragua is a totalitarian dungeon. Secretary of State George Shultz said the country was behind the iron curtain. Bonner posed the question, \"In what iron curtain country is there a newspaper that is vicious against the Sandinista government?\" \"Soviet entrepreneurs would salivate at the opportunities in Nicaragua,\" Bonner said. \"That's not to say Nicaragua is a democracy.\" Bonner feels the question is not what type of ‘Our policy in Central America is illegal, inconsistent and ill-advised. In Central America we stand naked and ashamed before the nations of the world.’ Raymond Bonner government a country has. but what right does the United States have to overthrow a political policy that does not agree with its own. Bonner said the best statement regarding U.S. foreign policy in El Salvador came from an P-piscopal bishop, who said, \"Our policy in Central America is illegal. inconsistent and ill-advised. In Central America we stand naked and ashamed before the nations of the world.\" that despite the fact that students deal with the Foundation daily through such operations as food services and F.l Corral Book.store. there IS little student understanding of the 'forkings ot t he non |irot't i-.ir p'l.ation that, in add'ti''n t -•pri . iditig , ainpu.'- --e'\\ n *•.. also raises lutiils for the iiiii versity through donations and investments. Students have little control over Foundation, Dunton said, because there is only one student member on the nine-member board of directors. “One voice in nine isn't a whole lot,\" Dunton said. The student representative, currently business administration major Lori Dematteis, is nominated by the deans of the different schools and then selected by President Warren Baker. Dunton said that was passed in March urging Baker to change the selection guidelines. Dunton, who said he feels there should be more students on the board, added he would like to see the student body have a voice in the allocation of the monies the Foundation takes in. He estimated that two-thirds of these funds are generated from students who patronize the Foundation-run Campus services. \"It's our money,” Dunton said. \"I think we should have some say as to where that money grx's Current Iv Baker makt«. recominerulH11('I'-i a« to Ik'A the ex.e'.'- funds will he -•peiU.

Students make the final decision at the ballot box, Dunton said. “Students voted to pay for their recreation facility \" at San Jose State, he said, and at California State University, Chico \"students have control of the whole operation.” Dunton said he would like the Foundation to be more accountable to students.

The crew team started rowing Thursday at 9 a.m. on a specialized rowing machine which, according to club adviser Bud Beecher, “is as close to actual rowing as you can get.”' been advising various groups for more than 20 years and has never seen a team with as much group enthusiasm. \"People in crew approach it more as a way of life,\" Beecher said. The majority of the money raised will go into building the boat house, a project the team will undertake themselves. The boat house is also a senior project for Michael Judas, a construction major. The construction equipment used will be on loan from the California Men’s Colony.

The university’s 23-member ooard of administrators Will vote on basketball Thursday. “I hate to see the program dropped, but he has some good points,” said Steve Master, sports editor of the school’s student newspaper, who met with Kelly last week. He said Kelly told selected students', faculty members and university personnel that he believed the current atmosphere of major college athletics is conducive to illegal and unethical behavior. He therefore wants the sport dropped permanently. Coach Ned Fowler and two assistant coaches resigned April 4 after Kelly learned illegal payments were made to some players, a violation of NCAA rules. 1 Also that day, an Orleans Parish grand jiiFy handed up an indictment charging eight people, including three players, in the gambling case. Two players, John Johnson and Clyde Eads, were granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for their testimony.
