    "article_text": "Cal Poly may have a reputation for producing quality engineers and agricultural specialists, but it may also be turning out teachers that cannot properly integrate computer technology into the classroom, said an education department professor. Professor Dennis Nulman said Wednesday that Cal Poly hasn’t shown enough commitment to adequately train teacher-education students to iise technology in elementary and high-school instruction. “It (Cal Poly) is failing to efH-ciently use its resources because we don’t have an organized plan to use them beyond the state’s minimum goals,’’ he said. “As a result, we’re getting students coming out with different levels of ability in technical applications in education.’’ As of July 1, 1988, the state requires that all students seeking a professional clear credential take two computer courses. A profnsional clear credential is a state-required fifth-year credential for teacher education students. The first of these courses can be any that fulfill the general education requirement for basic computer literacy. The second. Education 380X or one of several equivalents listed in the class schedule, is designed to show specific computer applications and devices teachers can use in a classroom setting. Nulman thinks Cal Poly should do more. “We meet the minimum goals the state provides,” he said. “You’d expect a polytechnic university to come out and meet more than the minimum goals.” Other members of the teacher education faculty, however, think Cal Poly provides enough instruction to teacher education students on educational technology. “I would say the present (computer course) requirement is sufficient,” said Professor H. Bernard Strickmeier, coordinator of the single subject credential program that trains students to teach at the high school level. Strickmeier, a mathematics professor, said the state Commission on Teacher Credentials sets a limit on the number of hours that can be required for a clear credential. Therefore, he said, increasing requirements is difficult. “Whenever you increase requirements in one area, you have to reduce in other areas,” he said. “You can’t just add hours and hours.” Bernard Troy, coordinator of the master’s degree program in computer-based education, said Cal Poly could “ask students to get better in technology,” but that they also could be asked to get better in a lot of areas. “Teaching students to deal with multi-ethnic and bilingual groups are priorities, too,” he said. “Schools and teachers also have to meet needs they never had before, such as dealing with drugs, abused kids and latch-key kids. We could demand a lot more of everything.” “There’s a lot of things you have to balance, and there’s also a practical limit,” said Strickmeier. “You don’t want to make the program too much of a hassle by having students needing to spend five years or more to graduate.” “We’re doing a pretty good job,” said Ken Palmer, interim head of the education department. “1 feel our students are coming out with enough skill to appropriately integrate technology in the classroom.” Lucy Falcon, currently working toward her master’s degree in education at Cal Poly, disagrees. Falcon received a liberal studies degree from Cal Poly in 1986. She said that the liberal studies program, which is designed to prepare students to teach at the elementary school level, didn’t train her enough to use computers in the classroom. “In my first year of teaching, I had a computer in my room and I didn’t know what to do with it,” she said. “Now I’m learning — two years after I started teaching. “Two (computer) courses is adequate for the clear credential, but one should be required for undergraduates,” said Falcon. It would have been more of a use to me and given me more understanding on how to use it in theclassroofn.” Nulman said another problem is that no one in the teacher education faculty has really discussed what computer applications are appropriate for classroom instruction. Nulman added that most committees, such as the single- and multiple-subject credential committees, have never addressed the issue. “There’s no perception that there’s a need for change,” Nulman said. “The people responsible have no interest in changing it, so they leave it up to the individual teachers to do what they want with their courses.” Nulman said this lack of consensus leads to a lack of consistency in what is taught to the students. “Two\tstudents will\ttake\tthe same class with different teachers, and\tthe\ttwo will\tcome\tout with very different levels of skill to use technology in K-12 classrooms,” he said. Jeff Weit, a teacher at Shan-don Elementary School and currently working for his clear credential at Cal Poly, agrees. “There are major differences between\tED\t380X classes,\tand the difference is in the instructor,” said Weit, who is taking ED 380X with Professor Pat Mulligan. “I have friends who have taken the class with other instructors and said it was a joke. They’d just review basic software\tfor\tApples,\tIBMs\tand Macintoshs, and after an hour everyone would go home and get an A. “One friend of mine said to me, ‘1 took the class and they told me 1 was computer literate, but there was no way 1 would have felt comfortable even turning on a computer in a classroom.’ ” Palmer, who has served as department head since Jan. 1, said no one has complained to him about differences in how ED 380X is taught. “This is completely new to me,” he said. Palmer said that each course has an outline that summarizes common learning objectives and that each instructor must base how he or she teaches that course on that outline. “If students have concerns about how someone is teaching a class. I’d hope they’d share them with me or share them with the instructor,” he said.",
