    "article_text": "It sure doesn’t figure, but the No. 12 Cal Poly Mustangs have a legitimate shot at winning the national title. The upset-minded Mustangs will take on the No. 7 Sonoma State Cossacks at 5 p.m. tonight in the semifinals of the NCAA Division II national championships. The game, the first of two semifinal contests, will be held in Melbourne, Fla. Little more than one month ago, the Mustangs crawled into the playoffs by narrowly beating Grand Canyon University, 1-0, at Mustang Stadium. Since then. Poly has played two dramatic nail-biters on the road — each ending in Mustang victories. The first was a 1-0 decision over San Bernardino, which had beat Poly earlier in the season. The Mustangs then became the first Division II sch(X)l to beat the No.3-ranked Seattle Pacific Falcons in two years. Poly barely beat the Falcons, 4-3. Tonight, Poly finds itself in the Final Four in a very familiar role — an underdog on the road. Poly has offensive weapons in Todd Henry (15 goals, 7 assists), Ryshiem Henderson (10 goals, 16 assists) and Lorenzo Cremona (12 goals, 8 assists).",
