    "article_text": "Cal Poly may have a reputation for producing quality engineers and agricultural specialists, but it may also be turning out teachers that cannot properly integrate computer technology into the classroom, said an education department professor. Professor Dennis Nulman said Wednesday that Cal Poly hasn’t shown enough commitment to adequately train teacher-education students to iise technology in elementary and high-school instruction. “It (Cal Poly) is failing to efH-ciently use its resources because we don’t have an organized plan to use them beyond the state’s minimum goals,’’ he said. “As a result, we’re getting students coming out with different levels of ability in technical applications in education.’’ As of July 1, 1988, the state requires that all students seeking a professional clear credential take two computer courses. A profnsional clear credential is a state-required fifth-year credential for teacher education students. The first of these courses can be any that fulfill the general education requirement for basic computer literacy. The second. Education 380X or one of several equivalents listed in the class schedule, is designed to show Should the Commencement Committee bring an outside speaker to address the spring graduating class? Should the ceremony be split into two separate ones? The Commencement Committee wants to know what students think about spring commencement. Meetings are now being held to decide things such as who the speakers will be and if there will be multiple ceremonies. Kim Waltrip and Jamie Howard were elected by the Executive Committee of Associated Students, Inc. last quarter to voice student opinions on the graduation ceremony. “We act as sort of go-betweens between the Commencement Committee and the student committees (of ASI),’’ said Howard. Bob Bostrom, chair of the Commencement Committee, said there were two ceremonies in December so students could get more tickets. “1 wanted to do away with the black market of graduation tickets,” said Bostrom. “Each student would get five graduation tickets. If you have two graduation ceremonies, you’ll get 10 tickets.” Last December’s commencement ceremonies had agriculture, engineering and science and math students graduating in the morning, while business, liberal arts, architecture and professional studies and education students graduated in the afternoon. President Warren Baker spoke at both ceremonies. Waltrip said she gets her ideas from students and friends, including her friends on the executive and academic committees of ASI. When Waltrip or Howard get suggestions, the ideas are presented to the executive committee and the commencement committee. If the ideas are agreed upon, they become part of the plans for spring commencement. Ideas may be submitted to Commencement Committee members or left in the ASI box located in Room 217 of the University Union. specific computer applications and devices teachers can use in a classroom setting. Nulman thinks Cal Poly should do more. “We meet the minimum goals the state provides,” he said. “You’d expect a polytechnic university to come out and meet more than the minimum goals.” Other members of the teacher education faculty, however, think Cal Poly provides enough instruction to teacher education students on educational technology. “I would say the present (computer course) requirement is sufficient,” said Professor H.
