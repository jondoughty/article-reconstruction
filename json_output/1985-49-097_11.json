    "article_text": "Wit.h the current school year coming to an end, the Academic Senate is accepting nominations for next year's university and state senators. The deadline for nominations to the faculty posts is today at noon, but the nominees will not face a general faculty election until laterin the month. There are 27 seats open on the university senate and one open on the California State University Senate. Members of the state senate serve concurrently as university senators. Consisting of a senate body and 14 committees, the purpose of the Academic Senate is to, allow a representative group of faculty members'\" to work with the Administration in forming university policy. \"The senate is a way of expressing formal faculty opinions on certain issues,” said Academic Senate Chairman Reginald Gooden. While all academic schoo|s are represented on the senate, the exact number of representatives is determined by the number of full-time faculty>ifreach school. The main body of the senate includes 56 faculty members, three members of the Administration and two representatives from the ASf. Working on issues ranging from budgets to curriculum, committees accumulate informa tion and send it to the senate where a resolution may be pu-^s-, ed. The resolution is then forwarded to the Administration for final approval. While the power of the Academic Senate lies mostly in its advisory function. Administration approval for senate resolutions is almost always granted, said Gooden. \"The Administration will only stop a resolution if it believes that the senate is not acting the way it should, \" he said. Gooden, an Academic Senate member since 1975. explained that the only real barrier to the authority of the Academic Senate is the fact that all resolutions must fall within the budget. “Once we decide the budget and how we’ll skin the cat it -becomes a faculty issue through the senate,” he said. He explained that while issues on curriculum originate with instructors and department heads, the senate is responsible for putting those changes into effect. The main body of the A.cadem-ic Senate meets once a month, while the frequency of individual committee meetings is baaed on how much need there i.^ for discussion.",
