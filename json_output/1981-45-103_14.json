    "article_text": "Saacial to m# Dally All season long, Cad Poly head track coach Steve Miller has been telling us how good his team is this year, about all the depth on his squad, and how his team is going to destroy all opposition en route to the conference and national championships. fhis weekend, we'll find out just how true the Words of Steve Miller are. The Mustangs travel to exotic downtown Bakersfield for the California Collegiate. Athletic Association ^championships this afternoon and Saturday. At stake will be not only the conference title and bragging rights for a year, but also a legion of individual matchups that will most probably be replayed at the national championships in Macomb, 111. in two weeks.\t--t, For example, take the 1500 race. Please. Toeing the starting line will be Poly’s aces, Vernon Sajlax and Paul Medvin, along ' with the nation's top metric miler, Frank Assunima of Riverside, Matt Blaty and Pedro Reyes of Pomona, and Ken Haney of Bakersfteld. All six runners are capable of running 3:45 or better. Another of those events that will have the fans on the edge of their seats will be the sprints, where Poly's Mark Kent and possibly Joe Siai Siai will clash with Northridge’s Steve Brodie the' former national sprint champion. In fact, the entire Nor-thridge team will prove to be the Mustangs' biggest pest at Bakersfield. The Matadors go two and three deep in each of the field events, and could heavily outscore Poly in the field events without winning an event. If Mu^ng Brian Paul wins the^^t put, as he’s expected ^ do, and Northridge geth second, third, and fifth, the Matadors would win the shot put, 18-10. Said Miller, \"According to the conference listing alone, Northridge could score 14 in the long jump, 17 in the triple jump, 12 in the discus and 21 in the hammer. They could be competitive without winning an event.” Aside from the key matchups, Miller, as always, is looking for his athletes to continue improving, and to return to the form they were in before the onslaught of invitationals took some of the \"oomph” out of the season. But this is somewhat like the case of the person who had nose siu-gery, but was afraid to take off the bandages for fear that his nose won't come out just as he wanted. One of the ironies of the conference meet is that Miller and friends won’t be able to show off the depth on the team. In 1981, 41 individuals and two relays have qualifîed for the na-tiohals, yet the Mustangs can take only 28 athletes to the conference meet. With the conference title on the line. Miller won’t fiddle around ~ with his lineup. Doug Avrit, a 5000 nmner in the nationals, will run the 10000 in Bakersfield, while senior Manny Bautiata, will do just the opposite. Another missing Mustang will be school record holder Ivan Huff who is the nation’s leading steeplechaser. Huff won’t run in Bakersfield, and Miller has him down as questionable for the nationals. Huff is still plagued by mononucleosis and strep throat.",
