    "article_text": "The results of a study on bulimia published in the Sept. 15 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine will not affect the treatment of bulimia victims at Cal Poly, said a mental health nurse at the Cal Poly Health Center. The study, conducted by Drs. Rodger Liddle and Thomas Geracioti Jr. concluded that there is an association between women suffering from bulimia and a gastrointestinal hormone which induces a feeling of fullness. “What we have at this point is an association where bulimics have low levels of a hormone,” Liddle said in a telephone interview. “It’s the first indication that there may be a hormonal abnormality involved. Bulimia is certainly a very complicated il- lness.” Bulimia, an eating disorder characterized by uncontrollable binge eating, is estimated to affect one in 10 to one in six college women ages 18 to 24. In the study, 14 bulimics were compared to a 10-member control group. Those suffering from bulimia were found to have lower levels of the hormone cholecystokinin than those in the control group. Rita Rich, mental health nurse at the Cal Poly Health Center, said she feels that although the study’s conclusion is based on legitimate facts, it is generally inconclusive at this time due to the limited number of people tested. “I think that it is probably something we need to continue to look at,” Rich said. The study also found that antidepressant treatment helped some bulimics and raised their levels of the hormone. “There are a number of women who are depressed as well as bulimic, but that isn’t true with all of them,” Rich said. Rich said she feels that factors in the cause of the disease can be sociological as well as psychological and are frequently related to poor self-esteem. The treatment of bulimic students at Cal Poly includes nutritional assessment and planning, a physical exam, individual counseling, group counseling and in some cases, antidepressants. Liddle said there are still many unanswered questions as to why the hormone level was low to begin with and why it improved with antidepressants.",
