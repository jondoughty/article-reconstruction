    "article_text": "Today let’s talk about ecotastrophe. What? Yes, ecotastrophe. It’s sort of a word from about 1970. The early ’70s were the heyday of environmentalism in this country when lots of people began to look seriously at problems such as air and water pollution and depletion of resources. Some people, including some very knowledgable ones, predicted that at the rate things were going, our delicate ecosystem would not tolerate humanity’s abuses much longer. Even then, most proponents of ecotastrophe were labeled as extremists and alarmists. And today, during a decade in which people seem much more concerned with their incomes than the quality of their air and water, predictions of environmental disaster are not receiving much attention at all. As you might have guessed, my sympathies are with the ecotastrophists. Geologically, IS years is a negligible time and the verdict is not in yet on most of their warnings^ And what’s wrong with being an alarmist if that means expressing alarm at a potentially caudysmic danger? Here are just a few of the environmental problems which could make our lives miserable, or even impossible, in the next century or so. Destractloa of the Earth’s OaoM Layer. It’s well-known that the stratosphere’s layer of ozone, which absorbs much of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation, is steadily being destroyed by various effects of industrial society. These include nuclear testing, jet plane emissions, auto emissions, agricultural fertilizers and aerosol spray cans. Recently, careful measurements indicate that as much as 0.3 percent per year is being lost worldwide. At that rate, in less than 100 years it will be impossible to go outside when the sun is out. But long before that, perhaps in only 20 years, plankton will be unable to reproduce, throwing the Earth’s fo^ chain into chaos. CoalamluatioB of Groaid Water. In the ’70s there was much publicity given to successful clean-up efforts of polluted lakes and rivers. The ’80s are bringing us a rude surprise: pollution (plus depletion) of ground water, though less visible than pollution of lakes and rivers, is a much more serious problem, in part because no one has any idea how to clean it up. The list of highly toxic chemicals which continue to find their way into our drinking water is incredibly alarming. By now almost every state has located serious ground water contamination. In California, Central Valley agriculture has caused major water problems, and even the supposedly “clean” Silicon Vidley microchip industry has severely polluted local water. Will life be tolerable in a world where the most readily available sources of water are too polluted to drink and perhaps even to wash in? the occaas. Directly and indirect- ly (via lakes and rivers), industrialized society has used the oceans as its main garbage can. Of course once our waste pro-ducts make it to the ocean, they can proceed to kill and contaminate ocean life. Marine biologists concerned about the huge increase in the concentration of toxic metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium estimate at least 23 percent of the DDT ever produced is now in the ocean. At the same time, high-powered modem fishing techniques have overfished many important fisheries almost to extinction. Jacques Cousteau estimates the total amount of ocean life today is less than half of what it was in 1900. Life on this planet began in the ocean. If we kill the oceans off, will life on land be able to survive? Radiadoa and Nadcar Waste. In the past 40 years, significant quantities of highly radioactive, long-lived isotopes have been created by nuclear weapons testing and the nuclear power industry. At least the nuclear industry is regulated much more carefully than, say, the chemical waste industry. However, the military and its nuclear wastes are not so carefully regulated. The verdict is no( yet in on whether our generation will solve this problem, but if we don’t, future generations (if any) may curse us for our stupidity. Editor — Mustang Daily (April 3) reported that the Cal Poly Foundation \"loaned\" $250,(XX) to the Intercollegiate athletic program and that the \"loan\" would be repayed by the general student body through fee Increases or higher prices at El Corral and Food Services. How can you call this a \"loan?\" It's a scami We, the students, haven't been asked (through referendum) If we want to raise our fees, and If we refuse to In the future they'll |ust raise prices at El Corral and Food Services to get our money that way. Maybe this \"creative financing\" wouldn't bother me so much If the money was to be spent in a way that benefitted the majority of Cal Poly students, but It won't be. The money Is to go to athletic scholarships (as you reported) so that a few hot-shot athletes can attend Cal Poly while the rest of us finance their educa- tion, as well as our own. Editor — Frequently we read In Mustang Dally complaints concerning Greeks. I would like to enlighten Cal Poly of the positive aspects of the Greek system. Each fraternity arrd sorority organizes their own events to raise money for local and national chari- tles such as canned food drives for the local Grassroots Association, marathon-type events for the National Heart Association and local blood drives. Greeks are also involved in campus projects. Alpha Sigma is In charge of maintenance of the \"P.\" All the fraternities operate and participate In the Interfraternity Council Escort Service, and on Good Neighbor Day every fraternity and sorority participates. Last year more than three-fourths of the partlcl- pants ware from the Greek community. In addition to philanthropic activities, most Graeks are vary active contributors to Cal Poly. Each year at least one-fourth of the ASI stu dent senators are Greek. This year more than half of the ASI PresI dent's executive staff Is Greek Greeks are also Involved In ASI committees, clubs, sports and other extra-curricular activities. In an effort to control the increasing number of backpack thefts at El Corral Bookstore, a video camera has been installed to monitor the backpack locker area at the front of the store. Public Safety Investigator Ray Barrett hopa the video camera, which was installed by the Cal Poly Public Safety Pepartment about two-weeks ago uid ctm-dnuaUy monitors the backpack storage area, will aid the department in catching backpack thieves. Aooordiiig to Berrett, the video camera has been very successful in awisting the department in its efforts to control such thefts. In a four-day period between March 28 and 31, four backpacks were reported stolen from the bookstore and an additional one was reported taken from the Snack Bar. But according to Berrett, many more backpacks are stolen from these areas on campus, yet students often will report sudi incidents only to the bookstore and not inform the Public Safety Department. To reduce the chance of having their backpacks stolen, Berrett suggests students check their packs into the check-in booth in front of the bookstore during the first week of the new quarter or put them into the coin-operated lockers. Berren reminds studenu that ■-the locker space is free, and although students must put a quarter in the locker to get the key out to lock it, 'the money is returned when the key is reined. If students leave . their backpacks umttended anywhere on campus, Berrett warned, the odds are the packs will be stolen. Students should take their backpadts with them or have someone they know watch the packs while they’re gone, said Berrett. If Fletcher Christian and Captain Bligh had known what being stuck in the same boat would mean, chances are neither would have set loot aboard.
