Black Canyon. “Okay,\" aays the gray-haired, tigfatfaced ranger, “I arant you people down there and in the river quiddy. I don’t e-have time to atay with you all morning.^ Down there and in the river, fast.\" He turns to his car. “Sieg haU,’’ I say in my head and exchange “Wall, nah-nafa to him, too” glances with arith my fellow trip members. Half the group salutes this back of the ranger’s head as he climbs in his car. * Wa are in the water with such speed and efficiency even I am impressed. No rookies, us. We’re with ASI Outings. We know a canoe when we See one, no problem. Some of us know how to steer one. too. The ranger scowls from the road. Soon everyone is in the water and we turn downriver, we have miles to -•» before we sleep. Wa get three hundred-yards. I can still see where we put in upriver, but natural bot springs are hiu^ to pass up. A showering waterfall of 100 degress Fahrenhait, poob in the rocks, and rain caves where drops of hot and cold water come from the ceiling along stalactites. We find an old water tunnel drilled for the dam that struck hot water of its own. Inside is a sauna, tepid water flowing from the end of the tunnel a hundred feet back. Hot springs, a sauna and a cool lagoon. I can tell some people are get- ting the “wilderness. wrong impression of Xt is still dusk. I would not know it if I did not look up out of the canyon. In hers; it is black already, tbs cliffs ranging against the deep blue of the sky. Venus is already out. I sit on an outcropping over the river as it runs black beneath me, no moon to reflect. Tbs lapping of the water against the shore comes up to me. There is a motion out there, it is felt. .^Lnother 1 - rock explodes in the campfire, shooting splintars into the crowd. “I’m moving,’’ someone ssys for the fourteenth time. Crystal’s tennis shoe catches firs, I watch it with interest for several seconds before pointing the flames out to her. It is now a sandal. Everyone’s knees touch, it is a warm night. I am trying to remember if I go to school, and. if I do, where? Is then s world outside of here, past the canoes, the cliffs and the Colorado River? (Now close to losing all pretensiona of being anything but the L. A. Canal.l A running $tory from amid tha laugh tor around tha campftrt: It starts with a 400-room mansion hotel on tha stormy coast of hfaina; it’s ~ propriator. Big Mama; and a thraa-hun-drad-pound cliant, Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown dumps his thin, blonds girlfriend soon after orrivaL She returns to New York never to be heard from again. Mr. Brown goes on to have a few scrapes with some ghosts, finally seeking help from Mr. Wizard (\"Hrip mel\") who sends him back to King Arthur’s time. But he arrives as a small mouse with wings who wins the Singing Sword and is then trapped in a birdcage by an an-cestor/looh-a-lihe of Big Mama. She frees him to face the challenge of the Black Knight, whom Mr. Brown, the flying mouse, then beats in a Jousting match. We then Jump back to the 400-room mansion: which is carried to an imaginary' land where\\Uves Harold, the rabbit. This world, actually Oklahoma, descends into nuclear war and total annihilation begins. The Singing Sword rifts through Harold, killing him instantly. A total reversal of world annihilation, but ru)t Harold’s death, is brought about by Mr. Brown, who is no longer a flying mouse, and the magic of the Siriging Sword. Then, Mr. Brown fights a long, final, pitched battle with the spies who have intermittently tried to steal the Singing Sword to aid their world domination. Mr. Brown kills all the spies and the world is safe again. All this without hallucinogens. People are going off to b^. I look up. tbs fin sprays rock again as-the sl^ across the canyon glows with the rising moon. X he safl pops in the wind as we slice across the cho^MOR water of Lake Mojave, my h^ whipping around my head. Three canoM are tied together to use a ' huge plastk tarp tied to canoe paddles and held up to the wind for a sail. Well, somsons has to rudder,’’ auyt Bob. “this is bard work.” ’The human moats jerk again with the srind and look skeptical. But, hell, fifteen miles without paddling... X be sky in the east is barely light. I crunch through the gravel of the desert, scuffing my boots, grinding myself into the diirt. Sagebrush against my lag, clean, crisp. 'n»e sky grows lighter, the two of us keep walking toward the mountains of Nevada. ’Too far away, but a gbal, nonethelsee. ^Tbe clouds over Arisona are now shot through with pink, orange spreads across the horison, the land is rosy. detailed. Tb* wind is light, not cold, hot warm. The Nevada hills in front of us ars now topped in red-orange sunlight, lava snow caps. It is getting too light too fast. Tlus is my first dawn outdoors in years, up before the sun. We sit. <m f rock and watch the sunrise. There are no pretensions, either by us or the land. Thaw are no lush ferns or carpeting moss, no towering redwoods to block the mountains for the trees. Just hard rock, shards of gravsL cactqs. sage. We ars only a humfawd fsst above the level of Lake Mojave itwo hundred above the “Colorado River” but we can sea down the valley thirty milee. The plain shoots away from the river and taker off up the mountains, capping wkh crags, lava red now almost to te valley. Ibe plains look like (me could run down them forever, never tiring, dashing for the river. Finally, the sun hits our rock, bright in our eyes. . The i^ow has cMssipetsd. nowa fadnt pink. Tha plain is now lit ^o, shadows of sagebrush strstchhig back toward the hills. I try not to think. As we hsad back down tha wash lor camp. I find a bone, bleached white. smaU. like a chicken leg. I stick it in tha bond of my hat with the feather already there. Standing motionless tm minutes, we watch a covey of quail as they gurgle iq> the wash past us.
