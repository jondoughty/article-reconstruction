    "article_text": "MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) — A crowd of young musk fans at the phish video bar, Heaven, watches Bruce Springsteen stmt his stuff with the hit song, \"Bom intheU.S.A.” ' Formally attired waiters serve ^drinks as Madonna, Phil Collins, Sade, Rod Stewart, Santana, Stevie Wonder and the Eurythmics follow Springsteen on a video screen. It's nonstop rock. The crowd loves it, but not everyone understands the lyrics. ' American music is popular throughout Mexico, and is even more so in Monterrey, a 214-hour drive from, the Texas border at Laredo. Monterrey music buffs can view three musk video programs a day that offer the latest American and British releases. Those with satellite antennas in the wealthy suburbs get nonstop MTV. Radio listeners have an assortment of English-language roek and record stares are ftill of the inpst popular releases. We’re very close to the United Sutes so the influence is in-evitabk, said Edgardo Resen-diz, a local television cuhural commenutor. \"These influenees are giving us a new musk culture. We have to learn to live within this cultural mix. Yet, the bombardment of American musk, which began in the 1960s, has not eclipsed the popularity of most styles of musk from Mexico and otho countries. Sergeant Peppers, a Monterrey discotheque, and dozens of other discos in cities near the U.S. border offer something for every musk lover. Dtec Jockeys spin lively \"salsa\" or \"cumbia\" melt^ies and patrons switch easily from rock to the Latin dances they learned as children. The popular national TV program, \"Siempre cn Domingo,\" features Latin entertainers singing Uve on Sundays for 4)4 hours. Mexicans were listening to the Spanish romantk singer Julio Iglesias long before duets with WilUe Nelson and Diana Rou helped launch his career in the United Slates.",
