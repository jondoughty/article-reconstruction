    "article_text": "If Ronald Reagan is serious about cutting the nation's defense spending he ought to consider using the Cal Poly men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basketball team as an inexpensive deterrent to nuclear attack. In twenty minutes of action during Friday night's CCAA opener against UC Riverside, the Mustangs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 1-2-2 zone allowed just two field goals and limited the Highlanders to fifteen percent shooting. But, just when it looked like a blow-out the Highlanders put on an all-out frontal attack. Using a full-court press, UCR scored the first ten points of the second half to cut Poly's lead to 26-18. A quick Poly time-out cooled off the visitors and the Mustang lead got no smaller than six points as Ernie Wheeler's troops held off UCR for a 46-37 win. While UCR was shooting fifteen percent in the first half. Poly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much better (thirty-three percent!. In fact, UCR outshot Poly for the game \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 38.1 to 37.8. The scoring difference came in the free throw department where the Mustangs outscored the Highlanders 18-5. Most of those came late in the game. ' Highlander head coach John Masi said the dif- ferenctf in the game was experience. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have two guys who have played in the CCAA before. When you have a lot of young guys they don't know what to expect. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be kickback and laissez-faire in this league.\" You can't win with only four players scoring either. Chris ^ntie and James Fontenette got their averages with 13 and 12 points, respectively, but no one else got more than 6. Poly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scoring was balanced as usual. Jim Van Winden and Tom Perkins each scored 8 points to lead the Mustangs. On Saturday night the Mustangs fac^ a markedly different team, accord- ing to head coach Ernie Wheeler. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Riverside is a quick team but Pomona is bigger and stronger,\" he said after Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win. No matter. The Mustangs adjusted well enough to register a 72-60 win behind a balanced scoring attack, led by senior guard Alex l,ambertson with 19 points, Pat Fracisco with 12 and Tom Perkins with 11. After the firat weekend of league play, the Mustangs are 12-4 overall, 2-0 in the CCAA. Next week, the Mustangs hit the road for the first time in a month, going to Northridge and Los Angeles for conference games.",
