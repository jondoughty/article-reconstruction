    "article_text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea showed its “great leader,” President Kim II Sung, on television Tuesday while ignoring reports in rival South Korea that Kim died or was embroiled in a serious power struggle. A Defense Ministry spokesman in Seoul acknowledged North Korean news media reports that Kim was alive and added: “We are closely watching whether these developments in the North have resulted from a serious internal power struggle or its (the North’s) high-level psychological warfare hiding a sinister plot for military provocation.” An Asian diplomat in Pyongyang, reached by The Associated Press by telephone from Peking, said he saw the 74-year-old Kim at Pyongyang Airport on Tuesday “and he is in absolutely good health.” The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added: “Everything is all right in this country, the situation is absolutely normal. ... There seems to be nothing correct about these reports (of an assassination or power seizure). ... It is absolutely normal, there is nothing wrong. He is absolutely normal, he is in good health.”",
