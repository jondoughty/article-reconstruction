    "article_text": "STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) — Five children were killed and at least 30 more people, almost all students, were injured Tuesday when a heavily armed gunman in combat fatigues invaded an elementary school and opened fire before taking his own life, authorities said. “At this point there are six dead and 30 injured,” said Bruce Fernandes, a spokesman for the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services. Deputy Police Chief Lucian Neely said five of the dead were children and the sixth was the gunman, who shot himself in the head after the massacre. “Before it was over, he killed himself,” Neely said, adding that at least 15 of the wounded were in critical condition. The police have “no idea” of a motive, Neely said. Lori Mackey, who teaches deaf children, said she heard sounds like firecrackers and quickly ran to her window. She said she saw a man standing in the schoolyard, spraying gunfire back and forth as 400 to 500 students from grades 1 to 3 were at recess. “He was just standing there with a gun, making wide sweeps,” she said. When she realized what was happening, she took her 10 students into a rear room where they couldn’t be seen, telephoned the office and locked her classroom door. “He was not talking, he was not yelling, he was very straight-faced, it did not look like he was really angry,” she said. Fernandes said the shooting began at about 11:40 a.m. PST and added that the victims were being evacuated to eight area hospitals. “We have at least 30 people that we’ve sent out to area hospitals,” said Police Chief Jack Calkins. “Naturally, they are in varying conditions.” Two helicopters and a fleet of ambulances were pressed into service to transport the victims. “I just saw him fall down,” said student Ramon Billedo III, who saw a schoolmate shot. “His head hit the ground. The teacher grabbed him and dragged him inside the other classroom.”",
