    "article_text": "About 20 members of the Young Democrats turned out at Osos Street\u2019s Rose and Crown while the College Republicans gathered in the University Union lounge to cheer their respective candidates in last night\u2019s presidential debate. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Vice President George Bush faced off in the televised debate Sunday night. \u201cWe\u2019re very serious ... about knowing what\u2019s going on,\u2019\u2019 said Shara Peters, Young Democrats president and cofounder. The Democratic Central Committee of San Luis Obispo sponsored the event at Rose and Crown to \u201cmake people aware of the issues,\u2019\u2019 said Tom Ferraro, president of the DCC. The mostly partisan crowd watched the screen closely, though the waitresses were kept running by a few who seemed to have come chiefly for the beer and food. Applause for Dukakis broke out early as he lambasted Bush\u2019s participation in the Reagan administration\u2019s dealings with Panamanian President\u2019Manuel Noriega. Bush\u2019s rebuttal that the CIA could find no proof of Noriega\u2019s wrongdoing was met with scattered grumblings and hisses. As a result, Ferraro said, \u201cBush never quite recover^. I think Dukakis rattled Bush. Dukakis came across as more of a leader.\u2019\u2019 Cal Poly student Brendan Martin agreed. \u201cBush seemed to stumble ... teemed unorganized,\u2019\u2019 he said. Martin said Bush, however, did seem \u201cbetter at off-the-cuff remarks.\u2019\u2019 The College Republicans reserved the television lounge in the University Union for viewing the debate, according to president Andrea Mundorf. The Republican Party of San Luis Obispo County did not sponsor any special events; volunteer Gary Kunkel said there were possibly some private parties planned. Richard Kranzdorf, political science professor and adviser to the Young Democrats, said there were \u201cno major gaffes.\u2019\u2019 Members of the Young Democrats saw Sec DEBATE, back page the debate more in Dukakis\u2019 favor. Member Stephanie Ball said Dukakis did a good job covering such issues as the homeless, defense spending and the concerns of the middle class. Other viewers remained confused with the outcome. Halfway through the debate, Eric Linxwiler, a senior speech communications/political science major, said disgustedly, \u201c(Dukakis) comes out with these cute one-liners and everyone claps. \u201c(The audience) was indirectly led to support Dukakis\u201d because \u201cobviously the panel was leaning toward Dukakis,\u201d he said. Organizers and participants were pleased with the 73 to l(X) viewers who attended the debate at Roae and Crown.",
