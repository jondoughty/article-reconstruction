    "article_text": "Simplification of the federal tax structure and a freeze on government spending were two of the topics discussed by Sen. Alan Cranston and a panel of 12 city residents at City Hall Friday morning. Cranston, the Democratic senator from California, spoke with the panel before a group of more than 60 residents assembled in the Council Chambers. He called the present tax system \u201cunfair,\" suggesting that it be replaced by a modified flat tax that would get rid of the \u201cunfair loopholes\u201d that exist in the present system. \u201cIn 1983...150 Americans earned S50 million and paid no taxes,\u201d Cranston_^ said. \u201cSixty-five U.S corporations earned $50 billion and paid no federal income taxes.\u201d With a modified flat tax structure, the government would be able to collect more money in taxes without raising them. Individuals and companies presently not paying their fair share would be more easily tracked down by the Internal Revenue Service under a simpler system, Cranston said. Also, if 'Americans felt the tax system was more equitable, he said they would be less inclined to cheat on their tax forms. Cranston said that although most deductions and loopholes would be eliminated, those in the interest of the general public \u2014 such as charitable giving' \u2014 would be left intact. Panelist Suzanne Yost, local real estate agent, questioned the senator on the implications of a flat tax. She said if deductions on investment property were cut, there would be little incentive for more building. In cities where housing is at a premium, such as San Luis Obispo, shortages would drive rents up, she said. Cranston replied that the proposed reforms would leave people with more money at their disposal for buying and renting, and thus would actually stimulate the economy. Jeff Colombini, a Cal Poly agricultural management student on the panel, said he was concerned about investors who buy up land as a tax shelter, consequently driving up property prices for serious farmers. \u201cI oppose that particular loophole,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cIt must be closet}.\u201d In regard to the deficit, which the senator .said is now,jpverjtt200 billipna year, CranstomsakP\u201cwe* cannot live beyond '^our means forever.\u201d He cited military spending and cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients as the main areas that are subject to cuts to reduce the deficit. Cranstbn said he is in favor of a freeze in the military budget as a means to curb spending rather than cuts in student loans, child nutrition programs or eliminating the cost-of-living increase for the nation\u2019s elderly, \u25a0 Colombini said the present system of allocating student loans needs to be reworked. Some students have abused the loans, he said, while other needy students are penalized by the system. For example, the governmenC bases a student\u2019s need for a loan on his parents\u2019 as.sets. Colombini said). \u201dA farmer's assets are in I land,\u201d he said, \u201cand he can\u2019t sell that to pay for his son\u2019s or daughter\u2019s education.\u201d Colombini also asked Cranston if he supported the elimination of crop subsidies. \"We need to review th'e whole farm program, \" the senator said, noting that farmers are paid not to grow food in a world that faces starvation daily. Cranston said the 90-minute forum was one in a series of town meetings designed to tap the views of Californians on subjects the senator will be voting on when he returns to Washington, DC. Two Cal Poly students charged with rape underwent further arraignment Wednesday and dates of future proceedings were set. James G. Blevins, 23, ^nd Manuel Perez, 43, appeared before Judge Dbnald Umhofer for a second arraignment and both were later released on their own recognizance. While Blevins had been released on his own recogpiizance following' the first arraignment, Perez had his $7,500 bail exonerated following a motion filed by his attorney. Perez is scheduled to appear for further arraignment April 17 and Blevins will will have a preliminary hearing May 2.",
