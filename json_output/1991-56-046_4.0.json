    "article_text": "San Luis Obispo may soon expand the city’s nuisance abatement ordinance to include noise disturbances. And that might cause landlords of noisy tenants to start reaching for their pocketbooks. The amendment would allow the city to press criminal charges against landlords of noisy tenants. Criminal action would be enacted if a residence is called on for “loud or unruly assemblages” more than twice in a 60-day period. After more than two contacts, landlords would be notified. They would be cited with an infraction on third, fourth and fifth visits to the residence. A sixth visit could subject the landlord to a $1,000 fine and six months in jail. Because the majority of renters in the city are students, there is concern about whether the amendment represents further action against them. But San Luis Obispo Police Chief Jim Gardiner said that the proposed amendment would not specifically target students. “This is not a student ordinance,” Gardiner said during a meeting at the police department Thursday. “The amendment relates to problem tenants, whoever they may be.” An average of 2,100 noise citations are given out each year. Gardiner said that only a small percentage of those violaters would*be affected by the amendment. “There is a small group that is causing problems for all of us,” Gardiner said. “(The amendment) is essentially to See NOISE, page 9 develop cooperation and working relationships with landlords and tenants to bring chronic problems to head,” Gardiner said. Marquam Piros, ASI Student Neighbor Relations representative, is concerned about how students will react to the amendment. “We’re going to have to look at this and ask questions from a student perspective,” Piros said. “We’re going to incorporate this into the educational process and tell students this is what the law is, these are your responsibilities, these are your rights. If you violate them, this is what will happen to you. “It’s also to make sure that the landlords are educating their tenants,” Piros said. Some students offered their reactions to the proposed proposed noise disturbance amendment. Pam Bills, biological sciences senior; “The judicial system has gone to the university to solve the problems. It couldn’t help. So now they’re going to the landlords. I think the whole thing is ridiculous. WTiy should a complete stranger be responsible and pay the penalty? I think it’s all the greeks’ fault. They are the ones who’ve had the major parties and have repetitively broken the noise ordinances. The judges are sick of seeing the same people over and over again. We’ve got a frat house just two blocks from us, and it’s ridiculously noisy. The residents are going to utilize this as a way to get students out of their neighborhoods.” Dave Weston, mechanical engineering junior: “They (the city) need to treat students as individuals on that basis. They need to deal with students directly and not goii around them. The cops also need to work with the students, instead of treating us as the enemy. But if you’re going to have a party, students should warn their neighbors before it happens.” Dan Jacobson, social sciences junior: “I think it’s going to cause more discrimination against students by landlords because they’ll be less willing to rent to students. I think it’s fine to notify the landlords (about the noise violation), but they shouldn’t make them pay the fine. That should be the students’ responsibility.” Gus Pendegraft, natural resource management senior: “I think it’s unfair for absentee landlords, those that live out of town, because they can’t really come down and monitor the tenants. The landlord shouldn’t take responsibility for the actions of his tenants.”",
