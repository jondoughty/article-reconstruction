    "article_text": "For the past 37 years a Cal Poly tradition has survived despite a lack of publicity —• a tradition rich with intensity and skill perfect for those who like to live life on the edge. This tradition, the Hi-Mountain Enduro race, began in 1950 and is an annual event organized by the Cal Poly Penguins Motorcycle Club. March 29, the Enduro race went off without a hitch with more than 4(X) riders participating in the event. “This is the most challenging event we put on,’’ said Poly Penguins President Kevin Lalor. “It is very intense and demanding From page 1\triders and work on\tgetting per- and this year ran\tabout\tseven\tmits, road blocks,\tetc.,” said hours.”\tLalor. “We also have search and There are many people involv-\t'h« '“P* ed in the Enduro.

The A class is the most difficult run, B is intermediate, and C class is the least difficult set of loops. ‘‘The terrain for the race is near High Mountain in Pozo, California,” said Lalor, ‘‘and is a great setting for this type of Enduro racing.” Riders also draw for starting numbers in the Enduro. ‘‘Four riders leave every minute,” said Lalor, ‘‘and must maintain constant speeds between checkpoints to avoid being penalized for going too fast or too slow.” ‘‘The race is really about rider ability, endurance, and overall skill,” said Poly Penguin treasurer Mark Bader. This year class A and B riders rode for about 85 miles and those in the C class rode 65 miles. ‘‘Speed does not win the Enduro,” said Bader. ‘‘Keeping a certain speed over a difficult terrain does.” Overall winners of this year’s Enduro were Pete Postel on a 125 Honda CR in class A, Jim Williams on a 250 KTM in class B, and Michael Nichols on an OPE Honda in class C. ’ Trophies, ribbons and finishing pins were just some of the prizes that went out to riders in the Enduro. ‘‘We try to congratulate all the riders,” said Bader, ‘‘even for just being able to complete the race.” ‘‘Sunday was the perfect day for the race because the rain earlier in the week settled down j the dust and made for good traction.” There were few complaints from the riders who participated in the Enduro. Mike Spanger, an Enduro rider said, ‘‘It was a real- ly good race. It wasn’t as technical as it had been in the past so it was more enjoyable. The last six miles of the loop were the best and were a challenge because of the risks of bottlenecks.” Bottleneck is a term used in motorcycle racing where there is one trail up-hill and a rider stalls, backing up all riders behind him. ‘‘This is the biggest problem with any race,” said Bader. Poly Penguins are part of District 37, which includes the Los Angeles area. Bader said the Enduro is a good race for this area. ‘‘Most of the riders in this district don’t get the chance to ride this type of terrain that often,” he said. ‘‘All the riders look forward to the event — 60 percent of them being riders from previous years.” When the race started in 1950, riders went through the city and out to Avila. ‘‘Now the competition is strictly off-road,” Bader said. Participants in the Enduro race also include former Poly Penguins. ‘‘They come back not only to race,” said Lalor, ‘‘but also to see films of previous years’ races and just to have a good time.” Cal Poly Penguins is one of the only college motorcycle clubs around. ‘‘No one has ever challenged this claim,” said Lalor, ‘‘and we even get students coming to Poly because of the club.” Engineering technology, mechanical engineering major Pete Robinson is just one example of this. ‘‘Granted, I was considering Poly for other reasons,” he said. ‘‘The fact that they had a motorcycle club just made it that much more attractive.” While the Enduro race is the biggest event of the year for the Penguins, the group is planning another event for Poly Royal, Lalor said. Trails riding is scheduled to take place during Poly Royal. ‘‘These are events that concentrate on rider balance,” said Bader. ‘‘The bikes are lightweight and the riders go over vans and cars.”",
