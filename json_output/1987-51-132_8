    "article_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court, significantly expanding the scope of civil rights legislation, ruled Monday that federal civil rights laws aimed primarily at helping blacks may also protect Jews and Arabs against discrimination. The court, in two unanimous decisions, in effect said that race may involve more than skin pigment. In one case, the court cleared the way for a suit by an Arab who said he was denied tenure on a Pennsylvania college faculty because of racial discrimination. In the second case, the court reinstated a suit by a Jewish congregation in Silver Spring, Md., against vandals who defaced a synagogue with anti-Semitic and Nazi-type slogans and symbols.",
