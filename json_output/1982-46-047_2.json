Supervisors Kurt Küpper and Jeff Jorgensen voted against approval of the plan, while Howard Mankins, Jerry Diefenderfer and Steve MacEl-vaine voted in favor of it. According to MacElvaine, the plan was given back a consultant who will make revisions in it before the board approves the final version. There is no specified due date for completion of the plan. 'The central issues discussed at the meeting were the lack of specific evacuation plans if there is a nuclear accident at Diablo Canyon, consequences of possible earthquake damage to Diablo, how to inform the public if a disaster pccurs and the lack of concrete disaster plans for surrounding cities and Cal Poly. MacElvaine said the board was concerned primarily with the sections of the plan that have no detailed explanation of disaster procedures. He cites a “lack of coordination with other agencies” as a cause for the weaknesses in the plan and said the “higher echelons” were at fault for not making the plan more specific. Jorgensen said possible earthquake damage to Diablo should be determined before the plan is finaliz- ed, but MacElvaine claimed a $250,000 study to determine if an earthquake will destroy roads was unnecessary. MacElvaine based his contention on Pacific Gas and Electric Co. studies that showed the Hosgri fault, which is 2.5 miles from Diablo, would not cause a severe enough quake to obliterate roads within a 10-mile radius of the plant. Representatives from the League of Women Voters said they wanted public notification if there was an “alert stage” at the nuclear power plant, but this was disputed because alert status at EHablo Canyon could include things other than a nuclear accident. For instance, a plane that runs out of gas and lands near Diablo would set an alert status in motion. 'The Office of Emergency Services has the responsibility to alert the public in case of disaster, said MacElvaine, so sirens aren't necessary for other problems. A major shortcoming in the plan, lack of detailed evacuation procedures, was discussed since many of the cities in the 20-mile radius of the plant have yet to develop their emergency preparedness plans. MacElvaine said evacuation plans should be developed for situations other than an accident at Diablo Canyon, since other disasters could occur. Xt is still dusk. I would not know it if I did not look up out of the canyon. In hers; it is black already, tbs cliffs ranging against the deep blue of the sky. Venus is already out. I sit on an outcropping over the river as it runs black beneath me, no moon to reflect. Tbs lapping of the water against the shore comes up to me. There is a motion out there, it is felt. - rock explodes in the campfire, shooting splintars into the crowd. “I’m moving,’’ someone ssys for the fourteenth time. Crystal’s tennis shoe catches firs, I watch it with interest for several seconds before pointing the flames out to her. It is now a sandal. Everyone’s knees touch, it is a warm night. I am trying to remember if I go to school, and. if I do, where? Is then s world outside of here, past the canoes, the cliffs and the Colorado River?

Big Mama; and a thraa-hun-drad-pound cliant, Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown dumps his thin, blonds girlfriend soon after orrivaL She returns to New York never to be heard from again. Mr. Brown goes on to have a few scrapes with some ghosts, finally seeking help from Mr. Wizard (\"Hrip mel\") who sends him back to King Arthur’s time. But he arrives as a small mouse with wings who wins the Singing Sword and is then trapped in a birdcage by an an-cestor/looh-a-lihe of Big Mama. She frees him to face the challenge of the Black Knight, whom Mr. Brown, the flying mouse, then beats in a Jousting match. We then Jump back to the 400-room mansion: which is carried to an imaginary' land where\\Uves Harold, the rabbit. This world, actually Oklahoma, descends into nuclear war and total annihilation begins. The Singing Sword rifts through Harold, killing him instantly. A total reversal of world annihilation, but ru)t Harold’s death, is brought about by Mr. Brown, who is no longer a flying mouse, and the magic of the Siriging Sword. Then, Mr. Brown fights a long, final, pitched battle with the spies who have intermittently tried to steal the Singing Sword to aid their world domination. Mr. Brown kills all the spies and the world is safe again. All this without hallucinogens. People are going off to b^.
