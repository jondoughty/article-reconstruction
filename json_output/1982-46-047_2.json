    "article_text": "Amid puUk opposition to its approval, the Board of Supervisors passed the county draft emergency disaster preparedness plan at its Monday ni^ meeting by a 3-2 vote. Supervisors Kurt Küpper and Jeff Jorgensen voted against approval of the plan, while Howard Mankins, Jerry Diefenderfer and Steve MacEl-vaine voted in favor of it. According to MacElvaine, the plan was given back a consultant who will make revisions in it before the board approves the final version. There is no specified due date for completion of the plan. 'The central issues discussed at the meeting were the lack of specific evacuation plans if there is a nuclear accident at Diablo Canyon, consequences of possible earthquake damage to Diablo, how to inform the public if a disaster pccurs and the lack of concrete disaster plans for surrounding cities and Cal Poly. MacElvaine said the board was concerned primarily with the sections of the plan that have no detailed explanation of disaster procedures. He cites a “lack of coordination with other agencies” as a cause for the weaknesses in the plan and said the “higher echelons” were at fault for not making the plan more specific. Jorgensen said possible earthquake damage to Diablo should be determined before the plan is finaliz- ed, but MacElvaine claimed a $250,000 study to determine if an earthquake will destroy roads was unnecessary. MacElvaine based his contention on Pacific Gas and Electric Co. studies that showed the Hosgri fault, which is 2.5 miles from Diablo, would not cause a severe enough quake to obliterate roads within a 10-mile radius of the plant. Representatives from the League of Women Voters said they wanted public notification if there was an “alert stage” at the nuclear power plant, but this was disputed because alert status at EHablo Canyon could include things other than a nuclear accident. For instance, a plane that runs out of gas and lands near Diablo would set an alert status in motion. 'The Office of Emergency Services has the responsibility to alert the public in case of disaster, said MacElvaine, so sirens aren't necessary for other problems. A major shortcoming in the plan, lack of detailed evacuation procedures, was discussed since many of the cities in the 20-mile radius of the plant have yet to develop their emergency preparedness plans. MacElvaine said evacuation plans should be developed for situations other than an accident at Diablo Canyon, since other disasters could occur. Editor: This Irttor ia in regard to the article printed on Thnraday. Jan. 14. “Minoritiaa Copa with Poly.\" I found the artide to be atatisticaQy informative. However, I alao found Um information praaantad to ba Umitod bacanaa racial, aodal or educational iaaoea • waren’t daah with in dapth. It waa my underatanding that tha intention of the article waa to anMghton the misedncatod Cel Poly atudent body regarding problama in human ralationa—iocaHy and internationally. Tha probiemi which people of color deal with at Poly are “peannts” coci^Muwd with those faced ou a dobal perapective; for azamide, the failure of Uw worid to recognize the African culture aa the father of human civilization. A local example of this ignorance ia the Greek Pratomity/Sorority system, which waa stolen from the Ancient African Mystery System. In fact, the Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato and friends were students of the indigenous African Mystery System, from which the Greeks wrote Western philosophies about echication and human relations. What Western cultures accept as ‘^original’'\tthought—Greek Philosophy—cams from the African Mystery SyMam. The Muêtang DaOy artide deale superficially with racial laenes by only quoting an unimportant inchiiuit I deacribed caauaOy during tha interview. Hie points not mantioned, which I amphasized, are to me much more dgnifi-eant and earious. To overlook more complex local and International-iaaoea ia to continue to deny their existencs. It’s difficult to deny that a child bom on the continent of India or Africa is Uksly to die of starvation befoiwits fifth birthday. To deny the existence of this problem Is the same as pouring poison into the swollen belly of a starving infant. - We, the Omega Pai Phi Frstsmity, feel our obligation is to speak to thsss concerns and not allow ourselves or this community to live pleasantly amidst this blatant ignorance. We must destroy the blinders which obëcurs our global vision. The artide reduced world problème to mm local incidents. Our concerns extend much farther.",
