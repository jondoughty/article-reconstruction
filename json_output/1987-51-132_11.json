    "article_text": "Most students will never meet Cal Poly President Warren Baker because his time on campus is cut in half by his off-campus traveling. Baker spends an average of 50 percent of his time off campus, according to his secretary, Grace Arvidson. This makes it necessary to divide his time on campus very carefully between the administration, faculty, students and community. “He is very involved and would like to be more involved with a lot of other (student) groups than he can,” Arvidson said. “But he is always accessible for the things he needs to be involved with.” Frequently students will approach Arvidson with personal academic problems, asking to see Baker before using other proper channels and Arvidson will have to redirect them. “1 will refer them to someone in the academic area: their adviser, a department head, school dean, or even the vice president of Academic Affairs.” Because of his many responsibilities, Baker does not have time to meet with every student and hear their personal problems, although he will make time for students who have absolutely exhausted other channels. “1 will help students who can’t be helped by anyone else and 1 always look for informal opportunities to meet with students. That’s when I learn the most,” Baker said. “What 1 do is try to accept as many invitations to student events as 1 can. I will also meet with any faculty member who wants to see me.” “He does have an open-door policy,” Arvidson said. “If a student comes in to see him and he isn’t busy, he will invite them in.” A few years ago Baker tried maintaining a weekly walk-in hour, “but it really didn’t work out, because students and faculty with problems came in trying to get the president to solve them. But he’s not involved with the day-to-day operations and doesn’t have time to solve problems that can be helped elsewhere.” Arvidson and Baker go over his calendar regularly to prioritize it, determining who he can see and what events he can attend. “He likes to meet with students. He enjoys them and has good rapport with them. He especially likes to meet with groups when they invite him.” Baker receives many invitations from groups and tries to alternate those he accepts each year so that he can meet with as many different groups as possible. He also meets with ASI, the Poly Royal Board and the Academic Senate on a regular basis, but even those meetings are subject to his busy traveling schedule. Baker travels every month to meetings with the California State University Board of Trustees, the CSU Presidents’ Executive Council, and the National Science Council, to which he was appointed by President Reagan. Before his appointment to the NSC, he held an appointed position on the Board for International Food and Agriculture Development. By policy, he can only maintain one presidential appointment at a time. In addition to these regular meetings. Baker travels to meet with many other organizations. This month he is going to Dallas for the first meeting of the Cal Poly Alumni Chapter there and to meet with local corporate leaders. He is also going to Washington, D.C. for a conference for the American Society of Civil Engineers Policy Committee on Engineering Research. He will also meet with Cal Poly architecture students currently studying in Washington. Baker said he met his universi-.y president once at Notre Dame. but with his busy schedule. Cal Poly students will be lucky to run into Baker. Students who really want to meet him may try to make a short appointment near their graduation time when Baker has been known to meet with students. Despite his busy schedule, Ar-vidson said Baker is always available if he is really needed. “There is never a time when 1 don’t know where he is by a phone call.’’",
