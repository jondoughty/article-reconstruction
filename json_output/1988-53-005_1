    "article_text": "Six Cal Poly departments received almost S278,000 in grants from the National Science Foundation\u2019s 1988 Instrumentation and Laboratory Program to fund equipment for various labs across campus. The program is in its fourth year. And Cal Poly has had an excellent record for the previous three, said Margaret Cardoza, director of grants development. Cal Poly had two grants in 1985, two in 1986 and three in 1987, totalling about S210,000. So, she said, getting six grants this year, totalling more than the three years before, was quite an accomplishment. Cal Poly\u2019s President Warren Baker was reappointed last year to the NSF\u2019s governing body, the National Science Board. The grants, ranging from $15,000 to $100,000, will help enormously in stretching Cal Poly\u2019s equipment budget, said Cor-doza. They will provide matching funds for new equipment in these departments:\tindustrial engineering, biological sciences, natural resource management, metallurgical and materials engineering, electronic and electrical engineering and architecture. This year\u2019s winning proposals are; \u2022\t$100,000 for a new, nondestructive evaluation facilty for the meullurgical and materials engineering department. Professor Daniel Walsh wrote the proposal. \u2022\t$50,000 for a data aquisition, analysis and presentation system for the natural resource management department. Department head Norman Pillsbury\u2019s proposal secured the sum. \u2022\t$45,900 to complete an electro-optics laboratory that will allow for broadening courses in fiber optics, and creates new ones in electro-optical engineering. Professor Michael Wollman wrote this winning proposal for the electronic and electrical engineering department. \u2022\t$48,850 to initiate three core lab courses for the new biotechnology minor program. Professor Raul Cano wrote the proposal for the biological sciences department. \u2022\t$18,400 for a pneumatic automation simulator for the industrial engineering department. Professor K.N. Balasubramanian wrote the proposal. \u2022\t$14,600 to buy equipment for an architectural science lab. Professor Donald Wollard wrote the proposal for this grant for the architecture department.",
