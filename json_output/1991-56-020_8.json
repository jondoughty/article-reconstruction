    "article_text": "There is new help for people suffering from eating disorders at Cal Poly. Kelly Moreno, a psychology and human development professor, is offering group therapy sessions for eating disorder patients beginning Thursday. The group sessions will be held during a class in group therapy counseling which is taught by Moreno to students seeking their master’s degrees in counseling psychology. Moreno’s hope is that the group will promote the recovery of clients as well as the ability of his students to work with eating disorder patients. “I wanted to run a live group so students could benefit,” Moreno said. needs take precedence. “Their needs and confidentiality come first.

Moreno said the patients will receive free group counseling — a service that would cost $20 to $30 on the private level — in exchange for being observed by use of a one-way mirror during his counseling class. Moreno feels Cal Poly, as well as the city of San Luis Obispo, are in desperate need of counseling services for people suffering from eating disorders. “If there wasn’t a need on campus, I wouldn’t be doing this,” Moreno said. “This whole community is understaffed,” Moreno said. “I can count the number of qualified professionals in the area on two fingers.” Jim Aiken, associate director of Psychological Services on campus, said Moreno’s work comes at a time when Elie Axelroth, a group therapy counselor of eating disordered patients for Psychological Services, is on a temporary leave from the university. The idea to run a group therapy program for both the benefit of his students and patients is a combination of Moreno’s learning experience and previous work in group counseling. Moreno’s idea stems from the work of psychologist Ervin Yalom, a famous Stanford University group counseling psychologist who originally demonstrated the benefits of group therapy. In addition, Moreno worked at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara where his medical director conducted a similar situation in which Moreno participated as a student learning group therapy.",
