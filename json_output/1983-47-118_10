Rebuck\u2019s letter \u201cSUtus of the Sea Otter,\u201d I would like to thank you, Mr. Rebuck, for enlightening me about those horrible, beastly critters known as the sea otter. With nearly 1,200 of those monsters swimming off the coast of California, I\u2019m surprissd that more people haven\u2019t been hurti Why, just look at how sneaky they are. TIm^ co-habitated with aU tte other marine animals for thousands of years just to get us off^ guard, than\u2014bami\u2014in 10 years they decimated our commercial shell fishing industryl Boy, they must be ravenous! I wonder how many abalone, crabs, and clams that Is per otter, per day?! \u2019They must be one big eating machine\u2014a mouth, a stomach and a Rebuck! I\u2019m worried, though. When they run out of shellfish, what\u2019s next? Dogs? Small children? Surfers? Mr. Rebuck, you scare me. If you and our illustrious Secretary of the Interior James Watt ever got together, 1 doubt there would be much of interest left in California\u2019s waters. I also doubt you have ev\u00ab- spent hours trying to hand feed a mariiie mammal that has been blinded and left to die by one of our commercial fishermen. If you would care to try it, or maybe would like to see some of the Dumy other atrocities inflicted by commercial fishermen, come with me some time to the California Marine, Mammal Rehabilitation Center\u2014I think even you would be disgusted! Let\u2019s hear it for \u201cemotional outojes\u2019\u2019-they show we care. I",
