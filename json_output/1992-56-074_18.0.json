    "article_text": "For the Cal Poly Mustangs, there is only one guarantee — win and get in. With three victories in its last three conference games, the men’s basketball team nets a ticket to the California Collegiate Athletic Association Championships. Every other scenario is a jumbled mess for the Mustangs and Head Coach Steve Reason. Season’s boys (17-7 overall, .5-6 in league) are in fifth place in the CCAA trailing Cal Poly Pomona and Cal State Dominguez Hills by just one game. Poly hosts the Cal Poly Pomona Broncos Friday at 8 p.m. in what turns out to be a huge game. In the result of a tie between the teams, the first tiebreaker is the head-to-head records between the teams, Reason said. The Mustangs have already lost once to the Broncos and twice to Dominguez Hills. If Poly is to even its record with Pomona, they will need a stronger first half. In their first game against Pomona, the Mustangs trailed by as much as 22 points in the first half before finally losing, 112-101. The Broncos are led by senior Chancellor McCobb, a forward who has averaged close to 19 points a game. Poly also hosts Cal State Los Angeles on Saturday at 8 p.m.",
