    "article_text": "AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) - Jack Nicklaus had reached the 15th green in the first round of the Masters golf tournament when he casually glanced up at the leader board. There, staring back at him from \u201d line of red digits that trans.ated\" into sub^par holes, were a couple of new \u00f1ames \u2014 Inman and Randolph. John Inman and Sam Randolph are amateurs, rookies who played the prestigious Augusta National layout Thursday as if it were some ordinary public course. Forget the* history and, tradition. Forget the lightning fast greens and the foreboding three-hole cluster called Amen Corner. Forget the legions of veterans who have been devoured by this challenging course. Here were two kids, one barely out of college the other stiU an undergraduate, shooting 2-under par 70s that left them two shots off the opening round lead. And Jack Nicklaus, five-time winner of the Masters who finished the first round one stroke behind them, loved it. * 'T thought, \u2018If this isn\u2019t a shot in the arm for amateur golf,\u2019 \u201d he ,said. \u201cI\u2019m tickled for them. Maybe' this will put some life back into amateur golf.\" Nicklaus was aware of Inman, whose brother, Joe, is a tour regular. The youngster went to school at the University of North Carolina with Nicklaus\u2019 son before graduating last December. Randolph,' however, was a mvsterv. \"What\u2019s his first name?\u201d Nicklaus asked. \u201cWhere\u2019s he from? How\u2019d he get here?\" Given Randolph\u2019s short biography \u2014 20 years old, a junior at the University of Southern . Californlg, qualified by reaching the finals of last year\u2019s U.S. Amateurs \u2014 Nicklaus nodded. Many years ago, he had played Augusta as an amateur. Did he think a non-pro could really win this demanding event? \u201cIt would have to be a college kid who\u2019s been playing constant, competitive golf,\u201d he said. \u201cInman\u2019s an outstanding player. I\u2019d be delighted to see him stay up and play well. But for an amateur to win, he\u2019s got his work cut out for him.\u201d Ig the flush of his fancy first-round, Inman, 22, could see himself slipping into that green jacket on Sunday. Really. \"I wouldn\u2019t rule it out,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can control my emotions, my game, sure, I could win-it.\u201d Randolph's ambitions are somewhat more modest,, \u201cI came in with ll(e goal of making the cut, playing well. If 1 do that, 1 'll giin for the top 2-1 ' Then with a glint in his eye he added, \u201cYou never know what wiU happen in this game.\u201d Indeed. But if either of them emerge from this gruelling four day test of golfing skills as the winner, it would be the first ' Masters title for an amateur Any amateur. Augusta National does not treat first-timers kindly. There are lessons to be learned, nerves to be settled. It can fluster the calmest golfer. Randolph admitterl that his knees were quivering on the first tee. Indian thought he wasn t even breathing at that point \u201c1 wasn't very nervoif- playing the finals of the U.S. .\u2022\\mateor. Randolph , said \u201cI had fi !t 1 belonged there.
