    "article_text": "DETROIT — Dr. Jack Kevorkian was acquitted Monday of breaking Michigan’s assisted suicide law after a jury concluded he was only trying to help a gravely ill man end his suffering, not cause his death. After the verdict, the 65-year-old retired pathologist challenged doctors who have secretly supported his cmsade to go public. “I know there are doctors who want to come forward,” Kevorkian said. “I want this intimidation by medical politicians to stop.” Kevorkian also said he is still receiving letters from sick people who want his help, but refused to say whether he would resume his assisted suicide practice any time soon. “I think this opens the floodgates for Jack Kevorkian,” said Lynn Mills of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. Kevorkian was charged See KEVORKIAN, page 5 in the Aug. 4 death of Thomas Hyde, 30, who suffered from the degenerative nerve disorder Lou Gehrig’s disease. By the time Kevorkian hooked Hyde up to a canister of carbon monoxide on a mattress in the back of his old, rusty van, Hyde could bare’y walk, talk or feed himself, Kevorkian, who had faced up to four years in prison and a $2,000 fine if convicted, acknowledged he supplied the carbon monoxide and placed the clear plastic mask over Hyde’s nose and mouth. Three jurors interviewed after the verdict cited a legal loophole and a technicality as reasons for acquittal. They concluded that Kevorkian’s main intent was to relieve Hyde’s suffering, not cause his death. Prosecutors had argued that part of the law was meant to apply to physicians prescribing experimental drugs for terminal patients. “We believe the intent was not to help Hyde commit suicide,\" juror Gwen Bryson said. “We believe it was to relieve pain and suffering.” Some jurors also didn’t believe the prosecution proved where the suicide took place. Kevorkian had initially told authorities the suicide took place in a Detroit park but testified at trial that it happened in the parking lot behind his apartment building in a different county. “I don’t think it’s our obligation to choose for someone else how much pain and suffering they should endure,” said juror Gail Donaldson. Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Timothy Kenny said he believes the evidence supported the charge, but “there were a lot of emotional hurdles to get over.” The verdict raises more questions about the future of Michigan’s assisted-suicide ban, which expires Nov. 25. Kevorkian’s five-day trial was the first time charges under the law had gone before a jury. His lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, said the verdict “drives a stake” into the ban’s heart. “This is the first chance for the people to decide,” Fieger said. “It wasn’t Dr. Kevorkian on trial here. It was everyone’s rights on trial hero,”",
