    "article_text": "A blow for the rights of AIDS victims was struck Monday when a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled that 5-year-old Ryan Thomas should return to the Atascadero school that expelled him. The Thomases fought long and hard to get their son into school. Not long after he was finally enrolled, the young Thomas was involved in an altercation at the school. Ryan was expelled for biting a classmate during a fight. He was then ordered to undergo psychiatric examinations to determine the reasons for the biting behavior. This was a ridiculous decision. Anyone who has worked with children of that age group can tell you that when a child is bullied he usually fights back. Biting is a common way for kids to retaliate. The Atascadero School Board expelled Ryan for fear the virus would be transmitted to other students through saliva. Most researchers do not believe AIDS can be transmitted through saliva, though this is not a proven fact. U.S. District Judge Alicemarie Stotler said in her decision, “As well-meaning as the board has tried to be, the medical evidence is that there is nothing to fear from this child.” This ruling is important for AIDS victims for two ' reasons. First, they can no longer be discriminated against because of their condition — the same right other handicapped people have. Second, it may help alleviate many irrational fears people have about AIDS. We applaud Judge Stotler’s rational ruling on this emotional issue.",
