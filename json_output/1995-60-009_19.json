    "article_text": "James said the new defensive system, which implements zone coverage and mixes up defensive play calling, gives the secondary an advantage that they didn’t have last year. “When you’re lining up, playing bump *n run, it’s very tiring for the comers,” said Lombardi, speaking of last year’s defensive system. The new defensive system is not the only reason for their improvement. With the addition of Davis, who came to Cal Poly from Oregon State, where he red shirted for one year, the secondary gained speed and toughness. “He’s a big guy,” Lombardi said. “He can come in and lay a hit, and he’s got the athletic ability to cover guys.” Patterson said that Davis’ potential is great. Davis hasn't played football since he graduated from high school two years ago. “We haven’t seen how good he can be,” Patterson said. “He’s only just starting to get better.” But without the leadership and the consistent play of Brown, who has NFL scouts coming to Cal Poly to watch video tape, the secondary wouldn’t be where it is now. Both Lombardi brothers said that Brown adds inspiration and leadership to the team. Just showing little tricks on the field that James didn’t know before help him improve his game every day. With the second half of the season starting Saturday at Southern Utah, the secondary looks to make an impression. They want to be considered as the best secondary in the AWC. “We’re pretty confident that well be the best in the AWC,” David said. A new defensive system that includes three new defensive backs has dramatically changed Cal Poly’s secondary — for the better. It improved from a secondary that gave up just over 300 yards a game last year, to one that allowed no more than 200 yards in its hrst three games this year. This turnaround didn’t surprise coach Andre Patterson. He knew the capabilities of the secondary. Furthermore, Patterson said the gap is misleading to a degree because last year’s statistics do not adequately reflect the secondary. *It’s funny that pass defense always gets put on the secondary guys, but there’s more involved in being successful against the pass,” Patterson said. \"The rush that you get from defensive line and the second phase is what kind of coverage you're getting from the linebackers.” At the start of the season there was speculation about the secondary. Could they stand tough against Big Sky opponents? Could they redeem themselves after last season? The Mustangs have gone a long way toward putting those doubts to rest with solid numbers. Excluding Cal Poly’s game against Weber State when the Mustangs allowed 522 receiving yards, the secondary has erased the negative specvilation. *We know what we need to do,” said sophomore safety Demetrius Davis. ”We’ve had a lot of speculation about us and I think we’ve proved them wrong.” Against NAIA opponent Western Montana, Cal Poly shut down junior Jason Truman, regarded as one of the best quarterbacks at the NAIA level, holding him to only 174 yards. One week later, the secondary shut down Idaho State. And after that, Montana State. *We wanted to be a respectable secondary,” said sophomore defensive back James Lombardi. *Last year we didn't get a lot of respect.” Lombardi and his brother Dave have added heart to the secondary, and their play at the ends of the field has earned them high praise. Dave was awarded the American West Defensive Player of the Week, after picking off Montana State’s quarterback and leading the Mustangs with seven tackles. ”Y)U always want to show you brother what you’ve got, along with the rest of the world,” David said. For senior safety David Brown, who is unanimously regarded as the leader of the secondary, gaining respect is not an issue. ”We know how good we were and how good we can be,” Brown said. ”We didn't really listen to that stuff too much.”",
