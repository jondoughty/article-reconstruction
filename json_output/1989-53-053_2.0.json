    "article_text": "Being runner-up for last year’s Poly Royal poster contest just wasn’t good enough. That’s why art and design major Malt Faye decided he was going to win First place in this year’s contest. “After last year, I was bent on winning,” Faye said, “and I set out to do just that.” The 2S-year-old junior said he couldn’t even begin to describe the amount of lime it took him to construct the winning poster. “It was a lot of work,” Faye said, “but it’s going to be worth it. “I almost dropped my other classes in a trash can just to get it done!” First prize included $I(X) cash and lunch at F. McLintock’s in Shell Beach. “The prize is nothing compared to the poster I’ll have in my hands,” Faye said. He described the prize as “Fame, fortune and recognition — and my own poster! They could have had a swift kick in the pants for a prize and I would have worked just as hard.” The last few posters have been loo graphic-oriented, Faye said. “I wanted to be more illustrative,” he said. “I wanted to show diversity and the different majors on campus.” Faye’s poster portrays the theme of the 57ih annual Poly Royal. “Unity Through Diversity.” It is constructed in 3-D, made from cut cansón paper. The reproductions, however, will have shadows to show depth instead of the original 3-D, Faye said. “I had to do a poster I could afford,” Faye said. ”1 always wanted to do a paper sculpture, and it was cheap. “I’m really enthusiastic about having won. For an art and design major, getting a poster printed isa big deal.” San Luis Obispo city planners are asking Cal Poly and Cuesta College students to help them find an answer to the student housing crunch. The city is trying to increase housing for students as well as for families in its General Plan update, said City Planner Gary Price Thursday at the Student/ Community Liaison Committee meeting. But the planners must know what students want in order to provide housing. “It seems that students prefer single-family houses away from campus,” Price said. But other city residents prefer that students seek single-family houses close to campus or multiple-family housing downtown, he said. City Planner Dave Moran said a survey may be used to solicit student ideas because the city has “underdeveloped or vacant properties that may be used for student housing.” Ideas are needed soon because city planners are formulating new student housing guidelines for the General Plan update, he said. In the meantime, to prevent problems between students and other city residents, a brochure promoting neighborliness is in the works. The brochure will be published jointly by Associated Students, Inc., and the city, said Jeff Schumacher, vice chair of the liaison committee. The brochure will cover such potential problems as party planning, trash, noise and parking, he said. The brochure will be distributed to Cal Poly, Cuesta College, local high schools and various city locations and Sec LIAISON, page 6 Second and third place were won by Eric Roinestad and Kathryn Otoshi, also art and design majors. Roinestad received a $50 gift certificate from Law’s Hobby Center and Otoshi received a $30 gift certificate from Graham’s Art Supply. The winners were chosen from more than 40 entries and are displayed in the University Union Galerie. Faye’s poster will be released March 1.",
