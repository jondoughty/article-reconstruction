    "article_text": "After three years of silence, the thunder of bowling balls rolling down lanes and crashing into pins can again be heard in the University Union. The Mustang Lanes bowling alley officially reopened last Thursday. Two referendums and months of debate and discussion preceded the opening. Tom Lebens, ASI president, said at the ceremony, “I voted against the bowling alley three times which shows that the students are the ones who actually decide what goes into this building.” The students seem pleased with their decision so far, said Marcus von Engel, student manager of the bowling alley. On Friday and Saturday nights, bowlers sometimes wait 30 minutes to get a free lane, he said. With Backstage Pizza also open, more students are slaying on campus for entertainment, he added. The bowling alley closed three years ago because it was losing about $30,000 a year, said John Stipicevich, ASI interim assistant director for operations and management. ASI considered several proposals concerning the use of the space occupied by the bowling alley, said Tony Celebrini, chairman of the University Executive Committee.

The physical education department will offer bowling classes next quarter. The Cal Poly men’s basketball team played “will the real Mustangs please stand up’’ again Saturday night. This time they came out winners even though they tried hard to lose in the second half against Cal State Bakersfield. The Mustangs roared to a 42-28 point lead in the first half and looked like they had the game well in hand as they extended their lead to 18 points. Then with about four minutes gone in the half, a double foul was called on Poly. After four free throw attempts and a missed fieldgoal attempt, the Mustangs lead was cut to 14. Bakersield found a secret weapon in Noel Nash who came off the bench and hit several three pointers to help the Roadrunners capture the lead with 10:14 left in the game.
