    "article_text": "The future of a three-year-old plan to construct a co-generation facility at Cal Poly will be decided in the next several months, the executive dean said Friday. Douglas Gerard said that the Allied Signal Corporation of Connecticut is evaluating final legal technicalities and the tax advantages of constructing the plant before making its final proposal. The privately owned and built plant will provide steam for campus heating and cooling as well as generate profit for Cal Poly and the state from the sale of electricity. “It is now to the point that within the next three months we will know if it’s a go or no-go situation,\" Gerard said. While the profits from the sale of an estimated 28 megawatts of electricity each year is still an attractive incentive to Allied Signal Corporation, changes in the tax laws proposed by the Reagan Administration may drastically lower returns from the $30 million plant. Co-generation was first developed in the late 1800s and uses waste heat from the production of steam to turn a turbine and produce electricity. With the availability of cheap energy beginning in the 1950s, co-generation fell out of favor. By 1977, only four percent of energy for industry was cogenerated compared with nearly 50 percent at the turn of the century. High energy prices in the last two decades have prompted large energy users such as universities, hospitals and factories to reinvestigate co-generation as a cost-saving strategy. A well-designed system, Gerard said, will produ« more than 1.60 times more usable energy from See PLANT, hack page Kalb’s sutement seemed to represent an effort by the Reagan administration to avoid a flareup with the fundamentalism Moslem regime in Tehran, which is listed by the department as a supporter of terrorism. Asked what the United States intended to do about the incident, Kalb said “we are evaluating our option.\" He declined to elaborate. However, the spokesman did say in a statement that a belligerent nation traditionally has \"certain rights” under the rules of naval warfare, to find out whether neutral shipping is being used to provide contraband to its Meanwhile, G. Quincy Lumb-sden Jr., the U.S. ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, was sent to Fujaira to meet with the freighter’s captain, Robert Reimann. In a precautionary move, two American combat ships — the destroyer Conolly and the frigate Boone — had been moved to the Gulf of Oman, where seven armed Iranian sailors halted and then boarded the President Taylor on Sunday. The ships were there “to prevent anything other than what happened,\" Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger told reporters at a breakfast meeting at the Pentagon. “The boarders left very quietly after an hour, an hour-and-a-half. There wasn’t any need for the kind of naval protection that the ship was seeking.” The Conolly and the Boone were near the Persian Gulf, but too far north to prevent the boarding, and yet “they were close enough that they could have prevented the Iranians from taking that ship under tow or forcing it to an Iranian port,” said a Navy source, insisting on anonymity.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A top Pentagon official, condemning private attempts to locate missing American servicemen in Indochina, said Monday the United Stata Is making progress with iu campaign to determine what happened to the 1,797 Amerkarastifl^nissing in Vietnam.\t— Richard L. Armitage, the assistant defense secretary for international murity affairs, told reporters that the Pentagon has 93 “live^ighting repohs** of Americans on file that it cannot dismiss as fabrications. But he added that the Vietnamese government,' in negotiations concluded last week, has pledged to investigate those reports. The Vietnamese also have begun investigating reports from their own people invoiving the status of missing Americans, and they arc allowing joint U^S.-Vietnamese teams to conduct “multiple” excavations at sites where American planes are known.to have crashed during the war. he said.

Their only losses in the last three months were by 16-13 to the New York Jett in overtime and 30-27 in Miami, losses they avenged in the playoffs. They beat the Raiders at the Los Angeles Colisetim a week ago, then eitded an eight-game Miami winning streak and their own 18-game losing streak at the Orange Bowl — giving them quality road victories over quality teams in games in which their season was on the line. The Cal Poly women’s basketball team broke even in iu first pair of league games over the weekend. The Lady Mustangs played in a warm University of Califoniia Riverside gym Thursday, but could only connect on a cold 23 of 70 shots from the floor for a 32 percent average. “We only lost by* seven, but they (Riverside) beat us worse than the score showed,” said assistant coach Jill Orrock. “There was a lack of intensity and drive — we went out flat.’’ The score at halftime set Riverside ahead 31-23. The Highlanders maintained their lead by outrebounding the Mustangs 31-40 and hitting 27 of 37 from the Field for a 47 percent average from the field. The Lady Mustangs trailed most of the game and didn’t pull to within seven until the last two and a half minutes of the game. “We Finally started to play some basketball in the last two and a half minutes,” Orrock said. Nonetheleu, it was too little too late. The Musungs lost 63-31. Barb Blackburn, a 6’2\" senior out of De Anza Junior College, hit nine of 21 shots for a game high 21 points. Teammate Janet Jorgensen poured in 14 points to go seven for 18 on the night. In another league match-up Saturday, Poly showed more in- tensity as it beat the Toros of Cal Sute Dominguez Hills- at their own game. The Toros, known for their agreuive play, lost to an equally agressive Cal Poly squad 63-39. “The Toros are very tenacious.” Orrock said. “But we were pretty tenacious ourselves. We made things happen and got to the (foul) line a lot.’’ The Mustangs showed a lot of hustle and determination, making 41 percent of their shou for the game and 47 percent in the second half. The second win “renewed our faith,” Orrock said. ^.Trish Oroo led the Musung attisek against the Toros scoring 16 poinu, while BUckbum continued her hot streak with 14 poinu. Jorgensen also checked in with a well-balanced effort of 12 poinu and nine boards. The Lady Musungs ended up the weekend with a 9-3 overall record and 1-1 in league play. The Musungs are awaiting the | challenge of the Maudors of California Suue University Nor-thridge. The Maudors will arrive in San Luis Obispo Thursday for a 7:30 p.m. match-up in Cal Poly’s Main Gym.

Sevend companies have made proposals for the plant in the last three years, but the recent recession and the volatik natural gas and oil price situation have in-crestsed the ' risk of building alternative energy facilities that require large capital outlays. The state decided not to flnance the plant itself, Gerard said, because it would tie up too much of the sute’s resources. With a private firm, the state invests only land. The builder will own and operate the facility and sell steam to the university and power to PO R E. Part of the income from electricity sales and the profits from the lease of land to the bulkier will be split between the state and the university to be used for energy related projects. \"The advantage to the university is primarily an aconomk one.\" Ocirard said. An estimated $5 miUioo will be generated over the first five yesus of operation. The university, which uses approximately five megawatts of clectrkity each year, will continue to buy power directly from PO R E and will purchase steam fropi the new faidlity. Under the current proposal, steam from the natural gas fueled plant would be piped nearly two miles to the current steam plant across from the Health Center, The 4,000 pounds of steam produced each hour would then enter the 36,000 feet of underground pipe that heat and cool the major buildings on cam-pus._ The distance from the plant to the campus core required a. redesigning of the delivery pipe to increase the efficiency of the system. \"There are some losses associated with the distance.\" Gerard said, \"but it is not a * ... within the next threife months we will know if it*s a go or no-go situation.* The present steam plam. whkh is showing signs of old age, has nof been maintained in top condition in antidpation of the new facility being built. Chief engineer for Cal Poly, Robert Pahlow,, said that rust is starting to detwriorata some pumps and tanks ahhough “then is probably a lot of good yean kfl in the boilers.\" If a CO gensratioa facility is' buflt, the machinery and welding programs would be rdooated in the old steam plant.",
