    "article_text": "Editor, Once again, in a feeble attempt to raise oontroveny and broaden the minds of its readers, the Mustang Daily has chosen yet another vmdereducated, irrational columnist to meet the deadlines of the Opinion section. Brian Johnson’s Monday column on atheism only furthered my theory of the growing number of fanatics religion has created. I am not opposed to religion, nor am I opposed to speaking your mind, but I am opposed to poor attempts to rsuse consciousness on our campus as Johnson did in his column. Being an atheist goes far beyond anarchy and lack of moral judgment as Johnson assumes in his column. It is based on belief in yourself. 'The reason for atheism is largely due to pressure to conform to the numerous restrictions laid out by the church. I cannot speak for all people who do not follow a religion, jiut as I understand Johnson doesn’t speak for all those who do, but the question of whether there is a divins power is not what makes someone an atheist. It is the loss of faith in the institutions that forces it upon us. A god is something more than the founder of right and wrong or good and bad, he is a faith that carries one through life. I choose to follow my own faith than that of someone who existed 2,000 years ago. It saddens me to hear someone speak like Johnson did became he is missing the point of his own god, and transforming his S3rmbd of good into a rule book. “Everything we do (and don’t do) is based on a belief in God,” Johnson said. I hope someday he can leam to do something for himself.",
