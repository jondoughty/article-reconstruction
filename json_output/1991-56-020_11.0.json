    "article_text": "Our foundinfi fathers drafted the Second Amendment to the Constitution to protect the country and its people. They believed Americans in the 18th centuiy needed to possess arms for protection against government tyranny and to maintain local militias. But the times and the needs of the country have changed. Too many guns are falling into criminal hands. TIk) many weapons wth the sole purpose to kill people quickly, efficiently and en masse are available — and being used. Too many people are dying. The time is now for the country- and its people to get some protection from the instrument that once helped ensure their freedom. Guns now are almost as ubiquitous as dirt. In 1989, U.S. gun manufacturers pumped out more than 4 million non-military pistols, revolvers, rifles and shotguns. Foreign manufactures imported thousands and thousands more. In 25 states, a person can purchase a shotgun at a K-mart by simply plunking down the money and showng a driver’s licence. If the person wants a handgun, the license has to be from that state. Guns are being ciimed not only by men and women, but by children as well. The Los Angeles Times in early October quoted an estimate that as many as 90,000 American schoolchildren carry guns to class every day. These are signs that gun use is in desperate need of control and restriction. The extremely high volume and availability of weapons in the country has been instrumental in creating social problems and augmenting existing ones. Many options exist that can effectively put gun use under control when used comprehensively. •\tEstablishing waiting periods for handgun purchases. Waiting periods would allow police agencies to check the purchaser’s criminal and mental-health record and therefore keep guns out of the hands of people prohibited to carry them. •\tA ban on all assault rifles, pistols and large ammunition clips. These are measures that outgunned police agencies have been advocating for years. A ban on these items would make killing sprees like the one in Killeen, Texas almost impossible. It would also make them much harder for criminals and gangs to obtain. •\tMandated safety features. Longer barrels would make guns harder to conceal. A ‘loaded chamber indicator” (which tells if the gun is loaded) would prevent accidental shootings. Combination locks would make it harder for criminals to use stolen firearms. These features are feasible with current technology. Firearm advocates, however, say that these measures would be either ineffective or infringe on their rights. These arguments have all the power of a pop gun. Gun control opponents say waiting periods would increase fraudulent gun transactions and transactions on the black market. These problems could be rectified by stricter and uniform punishment of gun traffickers. Gun control opponents say banning assault rifles would be bad because there are legitimate uses for them. What legitimate uses do these things have? Uzis, AK-47s and MAC-lOs weren’t made to kill rabbits. And they’re overkill for home defense. They’re overkill period. Gun control opponents say restricting purchases and ownership infringes on their rights, including their rights to protect themselves. That, however, is not the real reason most of them are concerned. As Alan Farnham wrote in Fortune, “The average gun store patron owns three handguns, two rifles and two shotguns. Anyone filling this description isn’t buying out of practical need. Nor is he Don Knotts, terrified of burglars. He liken guns — for their own sake and for the pleasure they provide.” And then there’s the famous “Guns don’t kill people. People kill people.” If that’s the case, then don’t give people guns.",
