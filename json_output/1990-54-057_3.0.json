    "article_text": "A Student comedy troupe. Loose Change, plans to bring relief to the county’s needy and to have fun doing it. A mixture of Cal Poly and Cuesta students Wednesday saw a demonstration of its new fundraising tool — a “pie in the face” booth during a press conference at D.K.’s West Indies Bar. The nine performers will travel next month to farmers markets throughout the county. Their goal is to promote their fundraising program called “The One-Percent Solution.” Michael Passarelli, creator and director of Loose Change, said if only I percent of the county’s population gave $5 a month, it’s estimated that 30,(XX) hungry could be fed. Monthly operating costs for the county food bank are S10,000, he said, most of which benefits senior citizens and children of the working poor. When county residents sign up for the program at the booth, they can throw a pie at a guest target. Passarelli said comedians, policemen, politicians and even employees for the IRS will be among those waiting for a taste of the whipped cream. Also for promotion, the See COMEDY, page 7 roup performs at two San Luis bispo clubs, Brubeck’s and K.’s West Indies Bar. Shows ^re free, but the group asks for a onation of non-perishable food r money for the food bank. Loose Change was formed for a ause, but many of the members ee that as an added benefit to he opportunity to perform. 1 get to perform my comedy iih the group up on stage and e also feel we are benefiting ome people less fortunate than s” said Matthew White, a Cal oly speech communications ma-or. “It’s kind of a two for one thing,’’ . Cathy Barlow, a Cuesta drama student, said her motivation to join an improvisational comedy group came from her desire to act and her love for comedy. “Improvisational comedy is something that makes you think,’’ she said.“It makes you explore everything you have in your mind.’’ Other members of the group include John Hamilton, Jennifer Fraley, Sarah Brown, Jennifer Johnson, Micheál Toles, Glen Starkey and Tom Fundero. Passarelli especially has put his talent and passion to work to help make life a little easier for those less fortunate. “There is no greater thrill than hearing a bunch of people laugh,’’ said Passarelli, adding, “There is a power in it when you hit the comedy button.” Being a hunger activist since 1984, he first got involved during a low period in his own life. “Sometimes the best way to help yourself out of a situation,” Passarelli said, “is to help someone else. “1 have a comedy mind,” he added, “and 1 always thought that if you came up with a way to have fun, yet educate people at the same time, you’ve got something that will last.” Finding something that lasts is necessary for the Food Bank Coalition, said Don Jacobs, the organization’s executive director. “The Food Bank has different sources of funds. One is governmental funds which are always temporary at best and to be able to sustain operation ... we need other sources.” He said the public was one of those sources. Passarelli agreed. “As time goes on, you can expect less help from the government,” he said. “History has already proved that. It’s up to ... (us as) in- dividuals in our own area.” The Food Bank Coalition of San Luis Obispo has been operating for one year. Jacobs said its purpose is to buy food in large quantities to distribute through non-profit organizations in the county. These include The Salvation Army, Grass Roots II and l.oaves and Fishes. The monthly $10,000 goal will operate and supply the warehouse. “If all it takes is writing a little $5 check once a month by 1 percent of the population, why not?” said Passarelli.“Why can’t we do that?”",
