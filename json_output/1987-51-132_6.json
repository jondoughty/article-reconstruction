    "article_text": "Although the drive-in has been an American ritual for more than 30 years, its future is uncertain. There are only 2,000 drive-in theaters left in the United States today, a sharp reduction from the all-time high of nearly 5,000 in the 1950s. Larry Rodkey, owner of the only operating drive-in in San Luis Obispo County, the Sunset Drive-In, said drive-in disappearance is caused by many factors. “The land that drive-ins take up is the major reason you won’t see any more drive-ins going up,’’ Rodkey said. “The owners of the land find it much more profitable to put in shopping centers. Also, people prefer to go to walk-in theaters because they can get better sound quality and a better picture on their screen.” Herb Gunn, manager of Fremont Iheatre, said 75 percent of the drive-ins that existed in the past five years are gone. “Because of expanding land values, it’s just not feasible for the owners of the land to use it for a drive-in any more,” Gunn said. Another problem drive-ins face is getting first-run, top-quality Hollywood movies from the major distributors, which usually go to the big movie chains such as Mann theaters. “The thing with film is that when a theater buys a picture, they have to put up a bid,” Rodkey said. “Around here the Festival Cinema usually wins because they can afford to put up the most money.” DARYL SHOPTAUGH/Mustang Dally Rodkey said the reason theaters such as Mission Cinemas, Fremont Theatre, Festival Cinemas and Madonna Plaza charge the usual $5 for a movie, while other theaters such as Fair Oaks and the Bay Theatre can show movies for less, is because the big theaters have to pay a high price to get a first-run movie, while smaller theaters have to wait until it’s played everywhere else before they can show it. “The first-run theaters have to charge the $5 just to pay for the movie they get,” Rodkey said. “The smaller theaters like the Fair Oaks and the Bay Theatre have to pay a percentage of what they make on the movie after it’s played everywhere else. The same applies here at Sunset. We have to pay back 35 percent of the gross we make. geared toward preparing students for further studies in the field. But with numerous GE requirements to fulfill, one class may be the only exposure to a subject students get. Most of what is covered is quickly forgotten, and anything retained is only useful when working crossword puzzles and watching “Jeopardy.” The “take this class, take that class” approach is defended by some who feel it encourages students to examine their options. But at Cal Poly, changing majors is discouraged. The theory at this university is a) know what you want to do before you get here, and b) do that. With these two conflicting approaches — opening students to a subject and then denying them the opportunity to pursue it fur- Even administrators know most GE classes are throwaways. With a wink and a nod, they allov/ us to take the classes credit/no credit so the grades won’t affect GPAs. Teachers, with a wink and a nod, grade on attendance and rote memorization. And students play “cram ’n’ forget.” All this winking and nodding makes me dizzy and nauseated. It’s not that I mind easy classes, but if I’m going to waste my time. I’d rather do it with a beer in hand and a Dodger game on the TV. An example of my point lies in the computer science requirement many students face. They get 10 weeks of writing programs in BASIC. But teaching programming to non-technical majors is like starting a driver’s training class with a detailed analysis of carburetors. The school systematically instills computer phobia instead of teaching how to choose a good computer and how a computer can help in everyday life. The misdirected efforts can be seen in the library’s computer room on any night: students cursing, crying and requesting help from anyone with an air of confidence. Every computer science student knows how pathetic the situation is, but that hasn’t brought change. To rectify the situation, two steps must be taken. First, departments must renovate GE classes so they are interesting to the masses — light on theory and memorization and heavy on practical use. Second, and more importantly, students should be given more control of their curriculum and a chance to build an enjoyable and useful schedule. After all, it’s not like they’re going to choose something easier than Biology 101. Editor — 1 am writing to express my concern over certain aspects of the college atmosphere. There seems to be a serious lack of social dating at Cal Poly, and San Luis Obispo as well. At first, I figured this to be my problem, but it seems that many others have also come to address this issue. I have tried many times to ask girls out, and have always ended up with the same old excuses, along with suspicious eye contact as to the nature of the request. Last year, I took a psychology class and was informed by the professor and several members of the Gay and Lesbian Student Union that approximately 40 percent of the female population at Cal Poly is lesbian. That seemed rather high. 1 realized that other factors such as population ratios, academically stressful environment and location of the university also have to be taken into consideration. Still, the ballpark statistic stayed in the back of my mind. 1 am happy to say that this quarter I have been dating girls in Santa Barbara. There is an obvious difference in social attitudes. There is more openness there and less emphasis on deriving one’s social life from a bottle of booze, as is the case here. In closing, 1 must say that my educational experience here has not been all negative. 1 have received a fast-paced education in SLO town! 1 also have a degree that says B.S. on it (and we all know what that stands for).

Cal Poly was the only campus with more than one winner. Kaste, a graduating senior in engineering, won for his design of a cooling system for the NASA-Ames Moffett Field Mach 14 wind tunnel nozzle. Kaste was sponsored by Ron Mullisen of Cal Poly’s mechanical engineering faculty. Karnazes, a senior in food science and nutrition, won for a computer program he wrote to compute and grade the nutritional content of breakfast cereals. His faculty sponsor was Kris Morey of the food science and nutrition department. Contributions for Notables must be received by noon Friday. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Despite some of the toughest anti-smoking laws in the nation, residents want even stronger restrictions on smokers, according to a California Poll published Monday. The poll found that most nonsmoking state residents are bothered when someone lights up. Whether they smoke or not, half of the people polled who live in California want smoking prohibited in airplanes. Large majorities favored restrictions on smoking in workplaces, hotels, restaurants and government buildings. “All of this is consistent with what we have said for years,” said Mark Pertschuk, executive director of the Berkeley-based Americans for Non-Smokers Rights. “The vast majority of people in California and the U.S. support limiting or completely eliminating smoking in places where people come together in enclosed places,” Pertschuk said. However, a different view was taken by Walker Merryman, vice president of the Washington-based Tobacco Institute, a major advocate of smokers’ rights. “I have to wonder if there is real sentiment for any further government intrusion or if smokers and nonsmokers are simply expressing their preferences without endorsing any further government action” to pro- hibit smoking, Merryman said. One of the first and toughest anti-smoking ordinances in California was passed in San Francisco in 1983. The poll, which was conducted April 3 through April 10 and has a projected error margin of 3.3 percent, found that 70 percent of those polled favored the designation of special smoking areas at work. Another 22 percent said smoking should be prohibited in the work place. CLERICAL ASST - Food Service Student wanted 10-20 hours/week -flexible schedule. Typing & ten key skills required.
