    "article_text": "Wit.h the current school year coming to an end, the Academic Senate is accepting nominations for next year's university and state senators. The deadline for nominations to the faculty posts is today at noon, but the nominees will not face a general faculty election until laterin the month. There are 27 seats open on the university senate and one open on the California State University Senate. Members of the state senate serve concurrently as university senators. Consisting of a senate body and 14 committees, the purpose of the Academic Senate is to, allow a representative group of faculty members'\" to work with the Administration in forming university policy. \"The senate is a way of expressing formal faculty opinions on certain issues,\u201d said Academic Senate Chairman Reginald Gooden. While all academic schoo|s are represented on the senate, the exact number of representatives is determined by the number of full-time faculty>ifreach school. The main body of the senate includes 56 faculty members, three members of the Administration and two representatives from the ASf. Working on issues ranging from budgets to curriculum, committees accumulate informa tion and send it to the senate where a resolution may be pu-^s-, ed. The resolution is then forwarded to the Administration for final approval. While the power of the Academic Senate lies mostly in its advisory function. Administration approval for senate resolutions is almost always granted, said Gooden. \"The Administration will only stop a resolution if it believes that the senate is not acting the way it should, \" he said. Gooden, an Academic Senate member since 1975. explained that the only real barrier to the authority of the Academic Senate is the fact that all resolutions must fall within the budget. \u201cOnce we decide the budget and how we\u2019ll skin the cat it -becomes a faculty issue through the senate,\u201d he said. He explained that while issues on curriculum originate with instructors and department heads, the senate is responsible for putting those changes into effect. The main body of the A.cadem-ic Senate meets once a month, while the frequency of individual committee meetings is baaed on how much need there i.^ for discussion. \u201cThey want it so bad.\u201d Those were the words of Crew Club President Bruce MacCoy concerning the dcesire of the crew club to be a \u201creal\u201d team. The crew club has been working out' since before January: three days a week with weights and four days a week running stairs and hills, doing wind sprints and extensive calisthenics. Practice starts at 5:30 a.m. The club just completed a row-a-thon in Mission Plaza to raise money for boats, rowing equipment and a boat house at Santa Margarita Lake. The crew team started rowing Thursday at 9 a.m. on a specialized rowing machine which, according to club adviser Bud Beecher, \u201cis as close to actual rowing as you can get.\u201d' They were sponsored by individuals and businesses on a per-mile-rowed basis. The goal of the team is to eventually raise over $^,000. Alternating turns on the rowing machine, the team rowed for 24 hours and put more than 600 miles on the odometer. Several members were gathered at the Mission Plaza waiting their turns and giving moral supporL Some were doing homework or studying and others were enjoying themselves by visiting in the sun. \u201cIt\u2019s just an,all-out help party,\u201d said MacCoy. Crew club member Anthony Gaspara, a sophomore agricultural managament major, said. \u201cWe want to put Cal Poly on the map as far as crew goes and we can't do that without boats.\u201d Mike Mensing added, between shouts of encouragement, \u201cI\u2019m so excited that we\u2019re finally get-, ting a crew team.\u201d Club Adviser Bud'Beecher hrs been advising various groups for more than 20 years and has never seen a team with as much group enthusiasm. \"People in crew approach it more as a way of life,\" Beecher said. The majority of the money raised will go into building the boat house, a project the team will undertake themselves. The boat house is also a senior project for Michael Judas, a construction major. The construction equipment used will be on loan from the California Men\u2019s Colony. A feasibility study to determine the effects the boat house might have on its natural surroundings will be the senior project of Dorene MacCoy, a natural resource managment, major. \u201cI\u2019m amazed that we\u2019ve got as 00^ far as we have,\u201d said MacCoy.   ____________________________ \"The hardest part is over but we rraxA, * o     .       -       kevinCANNOnai\u00abiw*n\u00abo\u00bbs\u00bb have a ways to go yet.\u201d \"       orew ciuD president Bruce MacCoy rows\u2019 away in the club\u2019s row-a-thon held last week in the Mission Plaza.",
