The Lady Mustangs played in a warm University of Califoniia Riverside gym Thursday, but could only connect on a cold 23 of 70 shots from the floor for a 32 percent average. “We only lost by* seven, but they (Riverside) beat us worse than the score showed,” said assistant coach Jill Orrock. “There was a lack of intensity and drive — we went out flat.’’ The score at halftime set Riverside ahead 31-23. The Highlanders maintained their lead by outrebounding the Mustangs 31-40 and hitting 27 of 37 from the Field for a 47 percent average from the field. The Lady Mustangs trailed most of the game and didn’t pull to within seven until the last two and a half minutes of the game. “We Finally started to play some basketball in the last two and a half minutes,” Orrock said. Nonetheleu, it was too little too late. The Musungs lost 63-31. Barb Blackburn, a 6’2\" senior out of De Anza Junior College, hit nine of 21 shots for a game high 21 points. Teammate Janet Jorgensen poured in 14 points to go seven for 18 on the night.

The Toros, known for their agreuive play, lost to an equally agressive Cal Poly squad 63-39. “The Toros are very tenacious.” Orrock said. “But we were pretty tenacious ourselves. We made things happen and got to the (foul) line a lot.’’ The Mustangs showed a lot of hustle and determination, making 41 percent of their shou for the game and 47 percent in the second half. The second win “renewed our faith,” Orrock said. ^.Trish Oroo led the Musung attisek against the Toros scoring 16 poinu, while BUckbum continued her hot streak with 14 poinu.
