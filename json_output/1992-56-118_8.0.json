    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Riot-scarred neighborhoods were peaceful but tense Sunday following the withdrawal of 4,000 Marines and regular Army soldiers. The pullout, and fear that 10,000 National Guard troops will soon follow, left some residents concerned the city’s undermanned and demoralized Police Department would be hard-pressed to keep the peace. “The police force is understaffed to begin with. Even though things are starting to settle down, we feel there’s a lot of tension out there,” said Ricki Schermerhorn of the group Mothers of All Colors Unite.\t^ The multi-ethnic group held a Mother’s Day news conference to urge officials to keep the National Guard in the city as long as necessary. “We want to keep our city safe. We’re all in this together,” Ms. Schermerhorn said. A police spokesman said there were no reports of violence or major crime on Sunday, but he said officers have reported an increase in sniper fire since the riot. Officer Bill Frio estimated officers and troops have drawn sniper fire on 20 or more occasions, although he had no official statistics on such incidents.",
