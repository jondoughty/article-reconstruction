    "article_text": "A thousand needy San Luis Obispo children are hoping to receive Christmas gifts this year from community members participating in the Secret Santa Program. The progi’am, started by the Salvation Ai*my, helps people in the community below the poverty level and families with special hardships. “It’s a really nice way that people can help needy children in the community,” said Salvation Army Captain Noreen French. She said that the program begins with needy people applying for Christmas gifts including food and toys. The children’s first names then are written on a tag to be placed on a tree in the community. Community members anonymously pick a tag off the tree and buy one of the gifts listed on the back of the tag. “The person who buys the gift can buy whatever gift they want to,” French said. The gift does not have to be on the child’s wish The participants then bring their gift back to the tree and volunteers make sure the gifts get to the children at Christmas. “It’s worked very well in the past couple of years,” French said. “That’s why we’re so overwhelmed with applicants this year.” Last year the Salvation Army served about 600 needy families. “This year we’re up to 1,000, and we’ve had to turn some away because of it,” French said. “W’e are hoping that the community will be responsive to the needs.” Last year, there were children left who did not get their names picked off the tree, French said. The Salvation Army provided those children with gifts donated by local businesses, individuals and college students. “This year, since we’ve taken so many more (children) and the economy is so bad, there may be a number on the tree that won’t be provided for,” French said. French said two trees would be set up this year — one at the Central Coast Plaza and another at Network Mall. Names can be taken from the trees seven days a week from the day after Thanksgiving to Dec. 16. All gifts must be turned in by the 16th in order to make the deliveries. Business Improvement Administrator Association Lynn Block said that there has been a lot of positive response from the community. “It takes 100 volunteers to man the tree. We can always use volunteers to help with delivery and organizing,” Block said. “There’s so many kids that need help and there’s tons of names on the tree,” she said. “You can make someone’s Christmas by being a Secret Santa.” French said that by contributing to the program, participants can get discounts from many local stores. The program has been a tradition with the Salvation Army since 1982. This is the third year San Luis Obispo has participated.",
