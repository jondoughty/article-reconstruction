    "article_text": "Nursing several injuries, the Cal Poly baseball team takes a much-needed break from the California Collegiate Athletic Association playoff race today with an afternoon contest against Division I UC-Santa Barbara. The Mustangs host the Gauchos (18-28, 6-9 in the Big West Conference) today at Sinsheimer Park at 3 p.m. Cal Poly (26-18, 13-10 in CCAA) will be without the productive bats of freshman second baseman Andy Hall (.349) and junior left fielder Bret Mueller (.333). Both are sidelined with back problems. This leaves the Mustangs with little depth on the bench but time to heal before resuming CCAA action Friday against Cal Poly Pomona. The Mustangs will likely rely on the offensive prowess of sophomore third baseman Jon Macalutas (.350) and senior center fielder Jeff Higbee (.340). Senior right fielder Kevin 'Tucker and junior designated hitter Rob Neal, both hovering around the .300 mark at the plate, could also prove dangerous to opposing pitchers. Senior Robbie Weeks (2-5) or freshman Tony Kuper (2-0) will get the nod for the Mustangs, who downed the Gauchos 9-6 the last time the two teams came together Feb. 23. “When you get down to it, we’re not going to look past this game,” Interim Head Coach Kent Agler said. “We’re going to concentrate on doing the little things and keep the momentum up for this weekend’s contest.” The Mustangs got back into the CCAA title hunt with a three-game sweep over Cal State San Bernardino last weekend, pulling to within two games of conference-leading UC-Riverside (34-15 and 16-9). UC-Santa Barbara looks to bounce back after dropping two of three games to UNLV last weekend and five of their last six Big West matchups. The Mustangs host Cal Poly Pomona for a three-game series starting Friday night.",
