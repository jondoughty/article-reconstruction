    "article_text": "PARIS (AP) — Police said Tuesday they believe two women from the terrorist group Direct Action killed industrialist Georges Besse, who was gunned down on the street outside his home. The president of the state-owned Renault automobile company was shot at about 8 p.m. Monday a few steps from his house in the city’s 14th district near the Monteparnasse railway station. Witnesses said the assailants approached Besse, 58, on foot and escaped the same way. Pamphlets found in a Paris subway station claimed responsibility in the name of Direct Action, a terrorist group of the extreme left that has carried out numerous other attacks, authorities said. A police spokesman said the printed statements “appeared authentic’’ and carried the organization’s symbol, a five-pointed star. The same spokesman said earlier that the source of the attack “is un- doubtedly Direct Action.” Police say that, according to the accounts of seven main witnesses, most of them neighbors, two women were directly involved in the murder.",
