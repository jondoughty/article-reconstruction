The two victories enabled Cal Poly to win the CCAA for the second consecutive year and the third out of the last four years. Cal Poly will start preparing for next weekend’s Western ^gionals of the Division II NCAA College World Series. It will be announced sometime today where the regionals are going to be played and who will be participating. “The fun begins now,” said Cal Poly Head Coach Steve McFarland. “I told the guys that they should not agonize anymore. They accomplished something great. “It’s an honor to play in the regionals. They have worked really hard this year and they deserve to be where they are right now.” Cal Poly finishes the regular season with an overall record of 35-16 and 20-10 in the CCAA. The Coyotes finish the regular season at the bottom of the CCAA with a 7-23 record. , In the first game. Cal Poly gave starting pitcher Paul Souza plenty of breathing room with some explosive offense to win, 6-3. I Irt what is becoming a common occurrence in the CCAA, Cal Poly pitcher Eric Hill hdd yet another dominating performance in the second game to help Cal Poly win, 5-2. “We played a lot better tonight,” McFarland said, referring to Friday’s 6-4 loss. “We eliminated some frustrations and played solid baseball.” In the first game. Cal Poly got an early See BASEBALL, page 6 start in the first inning when in-fielder Mike Oakland hit a sacrifice fly to drive in outfielder Phil James. After infielder Duke Dodder hit an RBI single in the third inning, catcher Paul Camber dell a scored on an error in the fourth inning to give Cal Poly a 3-0 lead. Cal Poly then erupted for three runs in the seventh inning. Outfielder Juan Rojo started off the bashing with an RBI single. Once designated h' ter Matt Drake walked, the stage was set for Oakland. He stepped up and drilled a two-run triple down the right field line, giving Cal Poly a 6-0 lead. “We hit’ the ball very well,” Rojo said. “The guys want the regionals real bad. Souza pitched a great game, and I think that turned us around and got the hit- ters fired up.” In the ninth inning, San Bernardino’s comeback attempt failed by only mustering three runs. San Bernardino scored two runs off Souza and one run off relief pitcher Chal Fanning, who relieved Souza in the ninth inning with no outs. Souza, who came into the game with a 6-2 record in the CCAA and a 2.98 ERA, gave up only three hits and struck out four players in eight innings of work. “I think the key to the game was that we were able to get an early lead,” McFarland said. “We really jumped on the ball.” In game two. Hill was, once again, the key to the game. Hill, who came in with a 6-1 record and 2.37 ERA in the CCAA, pitched all seven innings, struck out six and gave up five hits.",
