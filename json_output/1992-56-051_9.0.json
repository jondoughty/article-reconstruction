    "article_text": "When she was seven months old, she was bitten by a mosquito and infected with encephalitis. She went from being a healthy bouncing newborn to a patient in a Los Angeles hospital — blind, deaf and paralyzed. She showed no response to stimuli, not even sunlight shining in her eyes. Doctors told her mother she would always be this way. They said she should be put in an institution. Jean Blackburn was not ready to give up. Today, with the help of a devoted mother and dedicated volunteers, 7-year-old Katherine Blackburn can see, hear and read at a third-grade level. Her motor skills are improving every day. Her progress is the result of a controversial form of home therapy called “patterning.” “She’s come so far,” Jean said. Katherine’s first form of patterning gave her sight and hearing back. “We put her in a dark closet on top of a box with a Plexiglas top. There were 1,000 watts of light and basketball-type horns. They went on and off every two seconds. We had to wear earplugs. We did it 15,000 times, 25 times a day for eight months. “I remember one night I was sitting on the futon with Katherine in my arms thinking ‘I can’t go on. I can’t do this anymore.’ I turned on a flashlight to find something, and she squinted. It was her first facial expression. I said, ‘Oh God, its working.’ ” Patterning is a form of therapy in which continuous stimulation provides the opportunity for the healthy parts of the brain to take over for the injured portions. The stimulation breaks through the neurological blocks. Patterning, however, is not recognized as a valid form of therapy by the American Medical Association. “I patently disagree,” Jean said. Skeptics say that a patterned child’s success is not due to the treatment, but is something that would have eventually happened regardless, she said. “It may not work for everybody. Children that should be patterned need to have parents that are willing to do it,” she said. Jean says she is frustrated because she receives no money from the state for Katherine’s therapy. If she had put Katherine in an institution, the state would have to pay for it, she said. In countries like Italy and Norway, Jean said, the state subsidizes patterning by paying for a tutor and live-in help. “I’ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain. It’s hard enough to just get through everyday life with a hurt kid, but I’ve got to give her a better life,” Jean said. Once the connections start happening, they come fast, Jean said. “Once they get rolling, they don’t stop,” she added. The program Katherine is on was developed by internationally known physician Glen Doman, founder of the Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential in Philadelphia. “He takes the most hurt kids that others turn away. He takes the kids nobody will give any hope to,” Jean said. Jean said the bottom line of the program is to re-create the experiences of a well child. Most of Katherine’s current patterning is aimed at teaching her how to crawl. For this, three volunteers work her arms and legs and turn her head to simulate crawling movements. Jean needs three volunteers. eight times a day, seven days a week to pattern Katherine. She said that is why she moved from Los Angeles to San Luis Obispo four years ago. “I moved here because of the community support,” she said. Jean has about nine volunteers that are Cal Poly students. “The student volunteers I have now have been with me a long time. They spend hours in here in spite of what else they may be doing. It’s a shame they can’t get class credit for it, but it’s a credi\"; to them as human beings.” Bob George, a computer science senior, said, “I didn’t dj this for any class. I can help and learn at the same time. What could be better?” he said. “It’s the best form of therapy during finals week — just to spend time with Katherine and Jean away from school.” George carries a full load at Cal Poly, works two jobs and spends eight hours a week with Katherine. “It’s hard to find anyone more in need of help or any child more injured,” he said. George said that when he first met Katherine, she didn’t seem like a 4-year-old because she didn’t communicate her feelings. “But now she seems like a 7-year-old because she’s really strong-willed,” he said. Last January, Jean approached all of Cal Poly’s department heads with an informational packet about Katherine’s patterning and a proposal that they give class credit for lab hours doing her therapy. “The only person who even called me back was the (former) computer science department head,” she said. Physical education professor Bob Meyers offered lab credit for working with Katherine last year. He called the patterning an excellent opportunity for students. “It’s much more than hands-on physical therapy. It teaches you to understand the gift of giving. It’s something that touches your life. It’s something you will never forget as long as you live. They (students) were profoundly impressed by the love and dedication of the mother. They could see the heart and initiative the child showed in her limited way,” he said. Ann Morgan is in charge of setting up internships for human development majors. She said that working with Katherine is not appropriate as an internship because her students don’t have enough of a physiological background. She said the work could be done as a senior project with the proper research. Tim Cardana, an ornamental horticulture senior, has been working with Katherine for almost a year. “Most of the volunteers are in majors that have nothing to do with this (therapy). It seems ridiculous that they (physical education and human development majors) are not involved. I’m disappointed.” Cardana said he found out about Katherine when he went into the Placement Center to look for a job. However, after watching the video about her, he said he just wanted to be a part of it so much that he volunteered his time. “When she laughs, that makes it all worthwhile for me. Her spirit is really great,” he said. James Long, an electrical engineering senior, said he feels students have a lot to gain from working with Katherine. “Here you’re working with a child, and you can almost see different parts of the brain working,” he said. Rebecca Owen, an English junior, has been volunteering — making educational materials and patterning with Katherine — for over a year. Owen prints up the books that Jean writes and illustrates. She said that with just one idea, she can make up to 20 books on one topic. She brought out a book about clothing and explained that Katherine receives aix)ut 20 “bits” of information per book. Rebecca also makes individual “bits” that consist of an 11-by-ll-inch flash card with a See KATHERINE, page 6 photograph and written information on the back, Owen said people might think they don’t have the time to volunteer, but she said everyone has an extra two hours a week. “Think of all that time we spend watching TV,” she said. Jean remembers, “when he Jean says, “Katherine loves her intelligence program more than anything.” Jean says that Katherine answers with her eyes. Jean is quick to add that just because the motor skills may not be there, it doesn’t mean the intelligence isn’t. “This is a brain injury. This Jean was a costume designer for ABC television in Los Angeles. Now, Jean cannot go out and get a job. Katherine is her job. Jean says that as a single parent, she has a hard time covering the costs of Katherine’s therapy. Katherine and Jean must visit Doman’s Institutes every (Doman) told me to teach her how to read I thought, This guy’s insane,’ but it gave her something to accomplish. I thought it was nuts, but she was really good at it. People like to do what they are successful at.” After Jean and Katherine read a book, Jean will ask questions that Katherine will have to answer, fill in a missing word or make a choice (solve a problem) about. can happen to anyone in any form, even from an accident. Students need to be aware of home health care issues. If somebody you love has a stroke, you’re the one that’s going to help them, can’t just hand them over,” she said. Right now, Jean is looking for a boarder who is willing to trade rent for patterning time with Katherine. Before Katherine got sick. six months to determine Katherine’s progress and the future course of her therapy. “I know she’s getting better because she’s starting to act like the “well” kids on the airplane — she complains more,“ Jean said with a laugh. “I admire her so much just for what she’s been through and how hard she tries. It’s a lot harder than anything we can liken it to,” Jean said.",
