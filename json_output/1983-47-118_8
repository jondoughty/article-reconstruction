Our administration does not understand that tha ptoblams in Latin America atom from the desire of an oppressed people to win their ri^t to a fidl belly. This inability to view the world as others do causes obvious political pto-blsms. Our laadars seam unable to stay out of distant aituationa they do not. understand. But this problem also effects our personal life because of the blunders and assumptions ws make ' with lovers and frimds. Before we can.expect our leaders to view the world with a lass jaundiced eye we as individuals must have this ability ourselves. I don\u2019t pretend to possess this ability to any great extant, but I remember one time when I did see the world through the eyesof a friend, I learned a valued lesson. It was the summer of 1976, and we were both working in an iron foundry in Loe Angolas. We worked on the pouring crew, transfaring the molton iron from a huge laddie into molds as big as a Volkswagan Bug. It was a hot. miaarahlaan^dangarous Job. Besidss Ilia tact we both hated our jobal my friend, and I had almost notUng in common; ha was black and from tha ghetto, I was from tha suburbs and was ths only Caucasian In tha plant. Wa had a good faisndahip baasd on our woifr. Wa iohad tog^hsr and worked wnl togathar, trying to make an ahnoat unbaarabls job a BtUs saaiar. But our friendship neves went outsids of ths irbn foundry. I was often confused by his attitudes on Ufa, and tho\u00ab^ I Ubsd him I was shocked to learn that he occasionally would pull a \u201cstick up\u201c just to get some extra money. When he asked me for a ride home, one day, Lgot an opportunity to see the world as hie did. and to undmtand his views a little better. He lived in Compton, in a run-down, black neighborho^. \u2019There was a number of abandoned cars' in ths strwts, and garbage in the gutters. Hm homes looked old a^ worn out. As wa pulled Into his driveway ha recognixea my growing discomfort. \u201cNow you know how I foal in Whitey's world, don\u2019cha?\" ha said. I told him I couldn\u2019t really know how he felt, but that I got the point. Thara eras not a whita faca around, and I Mt uncomfbrtabla. \u201cYa know, it woun\u2019t ba too bad if it want fo tha tuba man.\" \u201cWhat ths haD has talsvision got to do arith anything?\u2019\u2019 I askad incredulous- \u2022y- \u201cWhsnsvar I turn on tha tuba I saa Whitey,\u201d he said quistly, \u201cWhitey alwajrs look good, nica clothaa. nice house, plenty o\u2019 bread...\u201d Ha gave nm a hard look, \u201cyou aaa any o\u2019 that sUt around hare?\u201d I watched in silence as he got out of the car. cloeed the door ami walked toward his house. Down ths stipat there was a Itttla girl plasring jump-ropa in front of a bumad-out building, an old lady draasad in rags carrying a grocery bag and a drunk sitting on the curb with his head between his knees. \u201cNo.\u201d I said to myself as my fHsnd entered hie houae. \u201cno. I don\u2019t see any of that shit around here.\u201d",
