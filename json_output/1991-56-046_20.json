Firman said this has kept the team from reaching “full strength” in the meets. “Now that we know we’re going to have a team, things are going pretty well and everyone’s motivated,” Keller said. “I think that the referendum decision has made us better. We really had to work as a team to get people to vote and that really brought us together.” FiiTnan expressed excitement about the polls but said they are still subject to change throughout the year. He felt confident the polls will be a g(X)d indicator of the final places at the national championship meeting scheduled in March. Finnan said the highest the team has ever been in the Division II nationals occurred when the women team placed fifth and the men placed eighth. Last year, the women placed seventh and the men placed 10th.",
