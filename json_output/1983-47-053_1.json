    "article_text": "Donn Morris feels that punkers are stereotyped. The 21-year-old journalism major is what society has labeled a ‘punker.” But Morris doesn’t feel he's a punker. “1 call myself the average Cal Poly journalism student,\" he said. Morris sports a ‘‘mohawk’’ type haircut and wears layered clothing typical of the 50’s. He doesn’t wear dazzling earrings on his earlobes, nor does he wear tattered T-shirts that most everyone typecasts as what a punker should wear But still, Morris’ appearances have shocked some people and have even caused others to take action against him. When Morris came to Cal Poly four years ago, he said he looked like ‘‘yoiir average regular high school student who was becoming a freshman ” Soon after entering Cal Poly, Morris went through a transformation in his life. ‘‘1 don’t know whether it has to do with dorm-life breeding, though the one I was in was a zoo,” he said. \"College turned out to be the whole difference High school was a sort of incubation period. \"In high school you basically knew everyone, you led a very stable lifestyle. Then in college, you hear all the myths about the different people, and you're out there living with them-it’s different,” Morris said. One of the major differences in Morris’ life was the style of music he began listening to. \"1 was into every band in high school-Zeppelin, Van Halen, Aerosmith and Journey to name a few.” He said. \"Mainly I was listening to them because everyone else was listening to them. Then a few bands caught my ear and I really liked what 1 was listening to.” He began to listen to bands such as the Sex Pistols These hands, who were labeled punk rock, approached world concerns and questioned society. “They were addressing these problems, whereas the others were still singing about the same old stuff-all about love and how my baby left me and how I got my baby back,” Morris said. Soon after discovering these bands, Morris’ life was transformed. He got his haircut and slowly began to dress “differently from others.” He recalls, “When I showed up at Cal Poly, 1 got the haircut. 1 could count the number of people who looked like me on two fingers.\" After the change in his lifestyle, Morris noticed a change in the attitudes of people on and off campus. \"Everyone just started staring at me as though 1- was a stranger. 1 don’t think 1 was any different. 1 wasn't out to say screw you’ I’m going to look different. “It just pleases me, \" he said. I wasn’t out to make any type of statement like ‘Well, here 1 am,’ wasn’t trying to please anyone but me. 1 liked it. It pleases me. Before I try to please or displease anyone,—I’m going tp please me. ” Morris said. He began to notice people stereotyping him. \"1 couldn’t understand why. When 1 first got the haircut and the clothes, people were very vocal. 1 couldn’t understand why. They’d say things like ‘you godamn punker,’’’ he said. “I just couldn’t figure that out. If I was walking down the street and saw the strangest person on the earth, I don’t think I would start calling them names.” Morris said he found many people who thought of his lifestyle as \"wild and crazy.” \"You really get a lot of hypocritical analogy-stuff like punkers beat people up is one of the major stereotypes,” he said, \"1 can't say that it's not all true, but a lot of it isn't.” Morris recalls a time when a member from a motorcycle gang came up to him and began “screaming in my ear about what he thought of me.” “ the way I look, but my reaction to it is to act like it never happened. People are expecting a reaction- that I am going to fight back.” The number of people who have changed their lifestyle to that of a punker's has grown. Whether it's a fad or fashion, Morris doesn’t know. type of thing.” Because of his punk-lifestyle, Morris knows people view him differently. He knows that when he does start looking for a job things will be different. \"If I were to work on a newspaper or such. I’m sure I would have to look the way a journalist is supposed to look,” he said. \"It depends on the individual. I don’t dislike what people do...it’s their lifestyle,” he said. \"People are seeing things out there, and some of them are there just foUowing-the-leader He added, “I’d be just as comfortable dressing in that way. I’ll still think the same, I realize that. I have even had instructors who have gone out of their way to tell me that I may have to conform. I lead a lifestyle, but I’ll have to conform to the dress.” \"Most employers want to hire a nice, responsible person, and I guess responsible goes into the looks and dress,’’ Morris said. Although people think Morris seems strange because of his lifestyle, he said, \"I don’t feel at all like a revolutionist—though I 've been blasted by a lot of people because of the way I look. \"People think I’m strange, but I just think they look stranger, he add- ' ed. \"I’m not saying that what everyone elM is doing is wrong, but I don’t think that what I’m doing is wrong either.” SmII drawiiifs by Jill KiiacMc, staff artist I------- Jim Austin's letter on the antiwar movement {Mustang Daily 1/11/83) was disappointing but unsurprising. It was disappointing in the sense that he revealed a complete lack of ' understanding of tbs antiwar movement; it was unsurprising in that he merely reflected the predominantly conservative attitudes that accompany a widespread political unconsciousness. His criticism of the movement begins, of course, with gross oversimpliBcations of its belief and attitudes. He mistakenly characterizes the “peace” movement as a “hate” movement by saying that iwotestors hated everyone over 30, that minority groups hated whites, that women's liberationists hated men, that ecologists hated science and technology, etc. Hue series of assertions is prejudicial, blatantly false, and based upon a shallow examination of the facts. Protestors did not hate everyone over 30; they hated shortsighted, warmongering policies that were 1) established by local, state, and national governments, 2) rooted in self-interest and self-aggrandizement. 3) philosophically grounded in the specious post-WW II belief that America was “the protector of the FVee World,“ and 4) usually formed by middle-aged men. Minorities did not hate whites; they hated the prejudice and discrimination that were levied against them by whites. Women’s liberstionists did not hate men; they hated the traditional belief system (fostered by men) that locked them into roles as housewives and baby machines. The ecology movement did not (and does not) hate science and technology; it hates the unthinking use of science and technology to the detriment of our precariously-balanced ecosystem. These were and are the real issues, and they sould not be obscured by flippant, coercive rhetoric. Further, although it is true (as Austin implies) that some factions of the antiwar movement were composed of radical “fringe” groups-the Weather Underground and the Black Panthers, for example-the movement as a whole cannot be characterized by their activities any more than the Republicans can be characterized by the actions and beliefs of Jerry Falwell or Anita Bryant (or even Richard Nixon). Confusing the mwits of an issue with the character of one of its spokesmen shows weak thinking. something Mr. Austin de^nstrates repeatedly. Perhaps the most blatant example of this is found in his concluding paragraph. Ignoring for the moment Austin’s indirect assertion that McGovern lost the 1972 election because the antiwar movement supported him (again, an extreme oversimplification of the facts), and also ignoring Austin’s rather bizarre assumption that electing Nixon was a testament to the wisdom of the American public, we are left with his statement that “the abolishing of the military draft and President Nixon’s wind down of the Vietnam War took much of the wind from the sails of the movement.” Think about it. This is equivalent to saying that “granting women the vote took much of the wind from the sails of the suffrage movement.’!| That makes sense; when you accomplish your goals, there isn’t much need to continue pursuing them. Face it. The antiwar movement was a success. Despite Nixon's invasion (whoops, I mean “incursion”) into Cambodia and his rhetoric about “peace with honor” and “honorable withdrawal” (slogans even mme mindless than “love and peace”), the weight and strength of Amwican opinion was overwhelmingly against the war, and American opinion forced him to mid it. Contending that the American public ignored, loathed, and despised the antiwar movement (as Austin does) ignores historical fact and the flow of current events. Well, some people still believe that the world is shaped like a pancake, so I guess anything is possible.",
