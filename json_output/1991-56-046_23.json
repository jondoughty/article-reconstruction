WTiy should a complete stranger be responsible and pay the penalty? I think it’s all the greeks’ fault. They are the ones who’ve had the major parties and have repetitively broken the noise ordinances. The judges are sick of seeing the same people over and over again. We’ve got a frat house just two blocks from us, and it’s ridiculously noisy. The residents are going to utilize this as a way to get students out of their neighborhoods.”",
