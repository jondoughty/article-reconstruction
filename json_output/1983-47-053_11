    "article_text": "From page 10 The 4-12 Mustangs continue CCAA play this weekend when they host Cal State Northridge and Cal State Los Angeles Friday and Saturday nights, respectively. Both games are scheduled for 7:30 p.m. in the Main 03rm. Going into the Brst weekend of CCAA play, NOTthridge was ranked No. 15 in ^ Division II poll. Versus Riverside, the Mustangs held All-everything Donna Hammond-Mares to 21 points and 11 rebotinds. Entering ths game, the talented Highlander senior was averaging 24.5 points and 13.6 rebounds. But, ac-coring to assistant coach Darla Wilson, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what Hammond-Mares did late in the game which hurt the Mustangs, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do-:foul out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She had four fouls in the second half and then didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get anything else called on her the rest of the game,\" Wilson said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And there were times when she could have fouled out. In the second half alone, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ^amazing they took 20 free throws and we only had two. \u00e2\u20ac\u2122They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not that clean of a team.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u2122The Highlanders were 15-of-20 from the line in the second half, the Mustangs, were one-for-two. For the game. Riverside was 23-for-30. Poly five-for-nine. Be that as it may, the Mustangs still had their chances in the second half to tie the game. They were within two a few times, but could never knot the scoft. We just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the bucket we needed at the right time,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Wilson said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I thought we did a good job on Hammond-Mares. We held her to 21 points and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty shallow performance for her.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The Mustangs had five players score double figures. Ixeading the point production was Carolyn Crandall with 18. 'Kelly Ulrich \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 and Terrie MacDonald had 13 apiece, Michelle Harmeier added ' 12 and Nancy Hosken chip- ^ ped in 11. Hosken led the team with 13 rebounds. 'There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a heck of a bt Poly could do against Pbmona. \u00e2\u20ac\u2122The Broncos raised their record to 14-2. \u00e2\u20ac\u2122niey are 1-0 in the CCAA. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pomona is the best Divisbn II team in the nation,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Wilson said. \u00e2\u20ac\u2122The Bron^M shot 57 percent from the field (42-for-71). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s awesome. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there would have been a three-point line, Pomona would have made a dozen of them,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Wilson said. \"We were in Jackie White\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face all night and she hit jumpers from the sideline all night. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do a bt with that. We pushed as much as we could.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not in Urge numbers,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Wilson said of the Mustangs, who are now down to eight pbyers. Kathy Ferguson is out of actbn for at least three weeks because of a stress fracture in her right foot. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And everyone did expend themselves at Riverside bst night. I think that had a bt to do with our performance against Pomona.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Ulrich led ths Mustangs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in scoring against Pomona with 18. She also pulled in eight rebounds. 'Hiat tied Hosken for the team high. Harmeier had seven caroms, whib MacDonald and Alison Walker pulled in six apiece. Crandall had 14 points.",
