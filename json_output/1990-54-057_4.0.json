    "article_text": "Before addressing Jeff Coffman’s attempt at an argument (Jan, 22 commentary, “M.L. King undeserving of honor”), it may be pertinent for us to remember the words of a French philosopher who said: “No man is strong unless he bears within his character antitheses strongly marked,” This means even the greatest men have weaknesses they wrestle with. Martin Luther King Jr. was foremost a man. He was not perfect, but his accomplishments overshadow whatever faults his detractors will allege. King graduated from Morehouse College with honors at 19, earned a second bachelor’s degree from Crozier and was at the top of his class by age 22, flew through the master’s and Ph.D. programs at the prestigious Boston University to earn his doctorate at 26. He also founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was its first president, led the nation’s largest activist gathering ever, wrote five books, published more than 60 articles, had more than 3,000 speaking engagements and was the youngest winner ever of the Nobel Peace Prize. King’s accomplishments were cut short by his assassination at 39, but in those years, he single-handedly revolutionized American social and political life. Coffman constructed a three-stage scaffolding upon which I can hang his argument. Two criticisms don’t address aspects of King’s public life and moral philosophy, which ideally should be the only debatable subjects. They instead resort to speculations about King’s personal life and to guilt by association by giving his aides the hackneyed communist label. A third argument contains quotes so badly misconstrued they reveal Coffman’s malicious intent. As to King’s alleged extramarital affairs, Coffman erred in stating he should be classified with Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker because, unlike these ministers. King isn’t alive to deny or affirm the charges, he had a public life apart from his Christian ministry and should be judged on the basis of that, and finally. King’s widow and children firmly believe in his moral goodness on this count. Coffman targets some of King’s aides as associates of communism. It is not illegal nor necessarily un-American to associate with individuals who have communist ties; nevertheless, King was always anticommunist. He said, “Communism forgets that life is individual.” And King and the SCLC were both cleared in the FBI’s report to President Johnson. As to Coffman’s erroneous perception of King’s moral philosophy, his blatant misuse of quotes from “I Have a Dream” is despicable. The “whirlwinds of revolt” statement and all others King made of that nature show when he mentioned violence, he was only stating the fact of its already present existence — for example, in Watts or Detroit. King never condoned rioting or violence of any form. His notion of power was bound up inextricably in a doctrine of love and intrinsic unity of the human race. King deserves to be recognized each year because he was our first national leader to envision an America in which all of us thrive harmoniously. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and other American presidents were great men who rendered priceless contributions to our way of life, but their visions were exclusive of some, not inclusive of all. Because King recognized all of America so completely and unconditionally, it seems right the people of the United States recognize him and the truth of his message in the same spirit.",
