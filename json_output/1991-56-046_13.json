    "article_text": "1 am a Christian white male ilepublican in the middle class. That makes me one of the most hated people on campus! 1 would like to respond to Fran-ceska Gleason’s commentary (Dec. 4) regarding the “silent majority” and abortion rights. Ms. Gleason mentioned several times the idea of constitutional rights to privacy. I feel many people who flippantly use this term have never read the constitution because no such rights exist. It is a myth. If a child is being molested in the apartment next door to mine and I do nothing about it because I respect the right to privacy of the child molester, then I would be considered by most to be partially guilty of the crime. It would be ludicrous to not at least call the police. What claim then, do abortion rights activists have on such a right if child molesters do not? The fetus is referred to by Ms. Gleason as a group of cells. Did you ever stop to think that all of us are a group of cells. You just have quite a few more than a fetus. Also, the DNA chains which define every person as a unique individual are all in place from the moment of conception. I agree that a woman has the every right to control her body, but the fetus in her is not part of that body and the majority of the doctors present!” Yeah right. Don’t let them get away with it. Fight back. Fam.ily, friends and acquaintances have no right to ignore and overlook us during the holidays. Don’t they realize that the highest suicide rates are during Christmas? I would also venture to guess that most of these miserable unfortunates are Capricorns or Sagittaria ns. I have a solution. I just buy myself things at Christmas and tell people that their birthday presents were also their Christmas presents and they should be glad. If you get frustrated or depressed during the holiday, due to your untimely birthday, just remember what it means to be a Capricorn. Capricorns are half goat and half fish (not a pretty animal, but a successful one). They are the sign of ambition and loyalty and they look good in red and green. They are also stingy capitalists and you can see why. It all stems from a deprived childhood. Let’s not forget that Christmas babies are also Sagit-tarians, or Capricorns with Sagittarian tendencies. Sagittarius is half horse, half man and carries a bow and arrow. A much more pleasing animal to look at than the Capricorn (that’s where I get my good looks). They have a zest for life and are one of the most understanding and easygoing signs (that’s where I get my laziness). Anyhow, you combine the two and you have a perfectly balanced person with the best of both worlds. So what if you get jipped every year? These are characterbuilding experiences that you should be grateful for. It is nothing a lifetime of therapy can’t fix! Laura Carrillo is a journalism\\ senior with a concentration in‘^ public relations. This is hcj J second quarter re/X)rting for AIus | tang Daily.\t; in this nation would agree with me. The last of Ms. Gleason’s points that I would like to address is the idea that women will have abortions whether they are legal or not. If society was to follow that line of logic, then we might as well build motels that supply contraceptives and sanitary conditions where men could take the women that they intend to rape. Rape would be safer for both parties involved since although rape is illegal, it takes place anyway. I am pro-choice. I believe that all women have the right to ch(x)se whether or not to reproduce, but that choice has to be made before you get into bed with that special somebody and not after you get pregnant. Recently, two full-page commentaries have advocated a woman’s right to choose. The right to choose to murder has serious consequences for society. Of course, if we apply R. Wayne Ball’s open season on “parasites,” we could solve a great many problems, including overpopulation, welfare and homelessness (not to mention lawyers!). However, these wonderful benefits aside, murder is illegal, and abortion is the premeditated murder of a dependent person. Perhaps many of us are still “dependent.” Hmmm... Franceska Gleason should think out her reasoning a bit more clearly before she spouts familiar pro-abortion rhetoric and attaches her name to it. The “Constitutional right” that protects a mother’s choice to kill her unborn child should not be equated with the freedom of speech or freedom of religion. The decision Roe v. Wade is a highly controversial one and has not stood the test of time that the freedoms guaranteed in the Bill of Rights have. Ms. Gleason argues that a mother is “here and now” and an unborn child “being of the future” does not really count and is not deserving of the same basic rights. Each of us was “unborn” at one time. Each of us spent nine vulnerable months in our mother’s womb. Each of us was given a chance to live. Pro-life groups are dedicated to the belief that all children deserve this chance. Finally, you do not have to be a “religious fanatic” to be pro-life, as Ms. Gleason would suggest. You simply must have a sense of compassion for all humanity and a willingness to speak out for those who have no voice of their own.",
