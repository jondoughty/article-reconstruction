    "article_text": "Why are the students of the engineering technology department and the home economics department protesting cuts of their departments? Don’t they understand the budget problems that Cal Poly is facing? Don’t they recognize the fact that some departments must be cut for the good of the school? These are reasonable questions. But to shine a light from their perspective, one more question must be asked — why them? If this question was answered, '^hey would be forced to see reality. As it now stands, these programs are left to guess why they were chosen to be eliminated. If they were told in clear terms why they were chosen. they would be able to defend themselves. They would also be able to see why they are less important then other programs. If we accept the fact that these programs were being eliminated simply because the school is faced with budget problems, eliminating programs that cost the most per student would seem more reasonable. This would result in the largest amount of money being saved. This would also allow the school to graduate a larger number of students per year. Had these programs been selected from a hat, their elimination would be more justified. Two more questions should be answered before students of these programs change their major; which program is next in line behind these programs, and “why them?”",
