    "article_text": "After 23 people were killed by gunfire in Killeen, Texas, last week, the issue of stricter gun enforcement is once again thrust into the national spotlight. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizens of the United States the right to bear arms for both home protection and for the advancement of a national militia. It was the sucess of this national militia that contributed to victory in both the Revolutionary War and the Mexican-American War. Currently, there are more than 200 million firearms in the United States, discounting the police and the military. These weapons are owned by as many as 70 million Americans. Handguns caused an average of 8,000 deaths per year between 1985 and 1989. Gun-related deaths cause about 30,000 deaths every year. Government studies say guns are used in one-fourth of the most violent crimes. In England, where gun control is strictly enforced, there is a high rate of death by firearms. With possible legislation such as the Brady Bill (to put a waiting period on the sale of handguns) being considered in Washington D. C., the firearm debate will continue.",
