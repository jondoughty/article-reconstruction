    "article_text": "any Cal Poly teacher-turned-authors say writing textbooks is a demanding, often thankless job that holds very little promise of financial reward. Still, when interviewed, most smiled and admitted that they would probably do it again. Public administration professors Alan Settle and Carl Lutrin co-authored a book, against the many warnings they received. Lutrin said, “A lot of publishers told us that writing a book together is worse than being married, but our partnership works because each of us holds up our end.” Dividing up the chapters equally, the two teachers felt that working as a team would make the project more interesting. Lutrin said, “There’s a lot of truth to the (notion oO loneliness and silence in writing — there’s only the typewriter.” The joint effort offered the attractions of both company and feedback. Settle explained the reasons behind the writing of “American Public Administration and Concepts,” which is now in its third edition. “I could put the concepts I enjoy teaching in public administration and distribute them all over the country.” Another reason was name recognition for the author, which brings prestige to the university and helps students who ask the teacher for letters of recommendation. William Francois, journalism professor and writer of four textbooks, said that in the case of his mass media law textbook, he felt he could offer a unique perspective. “I can take legal ideas and concepts and work them into more readable prose than, perhaps, a lawyer could. That’s long been an advantage of this textbook.” Often satisfaction is the only reward a textbook writer receives for the hundreds of hours of effort that go into the project. Although John Devore’s first writing effort is one of the best selling statistics books in the country, he estimates that the payoff comes to less than $30 an hour. He said, “You have to go into it thinking more than just money; most of the textbooks are written because teachers have pride in the subject, or perhaps for reasons of ego.” Whatever the motivating force, a great deal of effort goes into making a first-rate book. Devore estimates he put more than 3,(XX) hours into research, writing and rewriting. He explained that textbooks are written in pieces which are shuttled back and forth between the writer and editor in an effort to catch all errors and work out any disagreements over content. He said, “You don’t see things like this in a novel, but in a technical book most publishers like a year in the production stage.” He added that each stage is important, though not always interesting. “Take indexing: it’s a lousy, thankless task. But it’s still important.” Sometimes a separate publication service is used to compile the book. Settle said that often these companies can make a difficult task even worse. He said, “They do the editing, composition and designing — it takes a long time and we had to push them to make the deadlines. Plus you get charged for every photograph, graph or case history published.” Once finished, textbooks are frequently adopted by the author’s department, although the method of choosing textbooks varies throughout the university. In the statistics department, the choice is made by a majority vote of all the teachers in that major. When it came time to decide on “Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences,” Devore did not vote. Jim Daly, head of the statistics department, said, “The teacher should have input to what book is chosen. But for the sake of appearances and to avoid putting pressure on others, it’s better if they’re not involved in the final choice ... there could be a conflict of interest. One reason they write books is to sell them.” He admitted that in 15 years at Cal Poly, he has never seen the teachers in his department reject a co-worker’s textbook. He said, “I think most faculty feel if they respect the person, that they’ll at least give the book a chance, if there are no major problems.” Francois explained why he chooses to use his own book: “I know my textbook better than any other textbook in the field, and I know how to present that information.” Lutrin added, “It’s not an ego thing ... I can’t tell if the book is good unless I use it in class. 1 could read the book 40 times (but) the only thing that matters is how the students respond to it.” Daniel Stubbs, head of the computer science department and co-author of two textbooks, pointed out a conflict of interest is not the only pitfall that may await textbook authors. He said, “When you teach out of your own textbook, you’re not being exposed to someone else’s ideas on the subject, unless you keep up with them on the outside. But when someone writes a textbook on a subject, then you can be pretty sure they know it.” One student in Lutrin’s class said he disapproved of teachers using their own textbooks. He said, “They are able to pick out minute details in the reading because they\twrote it.\tOr they don’t go over something in class because‘It’s in the book.’ ” Another student disagreed, saying, “The lectures pertain directly to text material, making it easier to follow. The teacher and the text work well together.” Settle said\tthat he\tuses the textbook to\taugment\twhat is learned in class. He said, “My lectures do not replicate my book ... I use the book as a point of departure to much more updated details.” Devore put it a little more bluntly. “I’ve never had a single evaluation that said, ‘Why did I bother coming to class?’ ” More often teachers are asking, “Why did 1 bother writing a textbook?” John Kimmel, sponsoring editor for Devore’s first book, explained why second and third editions are necessary. “When you write a book the »first time, people read it, but no one teaches from it. You can really improve it going from first to second editions.” He admitted that another reason for revision is to combat the evergrowing used textbook market in which national distribution companies have a profitable field. This money comes out of both the publisher and author’s pocket and can account for the poor return off of books as successful as Devore’s and Stubbs’. Kimmel summed up his problem: “A bookstore makes more money on sales of a used book than on the sale of a new one. Lutrin echoed this sentiment. He said everyone is making money off the used tex-tbook, including the bookstore, except for the author. According to Kimmel, college textbooks bring in more money for the publisher than other type of publication. Court Warren, El Corral Bookstore director for more than a year, said the store is not getting rich off of used texts; new and used books bring in the same sized profits. He said, “Used books are strictly a service to students.” According to him, the only reason Cal Poly buys back used textbooks is to keep costs down for students. ♦Whether the cause is used books, declining enrollment or just esoteric subject matter, Kimmel said it is not uncommon for a writer to spend several years working on a book and be rewarded with 3 to S cents an hour. For this and other- reasons, some writers have said “Never again.” Devore is one of these. He said, “They (the two books) have taken big chunks out of both my professional and personal lives. The thing is just with you constantly; with the teaching load it just becomes too much.” Lutrin reached the same conclusion, but for a different reason. “We were offered a contract to do another book for general education of American government, but I couldn’t convince myself that it was really needed. In (my) office alone there are 20 books on government that are really good.” Regardless of the negative aspects, both Francois and Settle plan to write again and Stubbs has already signed a contract for another text. The computer science professor said he enjoyed the experience that writing brought, but he could sympathize with a statement that Jimmy Carter made after working on his memoirs: “I thought being president was hard, but that was before I tried to write a book.”",
