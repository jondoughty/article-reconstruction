Yet. traditionally women have been denied the sacrement of priesthood On Sept. 20, 1988, from the Vatican City, Pope John Paul II released MuHen’s Dignitatem (On the Dignity’s of Women), the controversial Papal Letter that condemned sexism while reaffirming the church’s traditional stand on women’s roles in the Roman Catholic Church. Dignity, equality and the abolishment of sexism were continuing themes throughout the popes document. Yet. to many catholic feminists these were contradictory statements that reveal the dichotomy that exists between the church’s definition of equality and the status of women in the church. Brother Richard Maratto, administrative director of Cal Poly’s Newman Center, said that despite the pope’s decree “no doctrine or dogma in the Catholic Church states that women can not be ordained priest.’’ In his letter the pope calls sexism a “social and moral evil,’’ yet claims that it is a meditation on equality of men and women and their oneness in Christ Jesus — a unity that does not cancel out diversity.’’ In reaction to the papal message Arch-Bishop William J. Levada of Oregon joined the pope in denouncing job discrimination while supporting prohibition of women in the priesthood. Critics of the pope’s message say it narrowly defines women’s role in the church despite some of the positve affirmations — like the “dignity of motherhood.’’ Los Angeles Times staff writer, Roberto Suro quoted the pope, “Females have vocations of motherhood and virginity.’’ Suro asserted that according to the Catholic Church priesthood is not a job, but a (man’s) vocation — a relationship with God that gets its roots from the Old and New Testiments. The Vatican II specifically states that women cannot be priests because they do not “physically resemble Jesus Christ.’’ And it claims that Jesus chose men as his apostles and that women were not present at the Last Supper (when the sacrament of the “Holy Orders’’ was first instituted). Maratto holds an optimistic outlook on changing traditional roles of women in the church “1 think that all of us realize every institution is going through changes. The Catholic Church is not excluded. We reflect changes that go on in society.’’ Catholic feminist, Alice Laffey, who leads the religious studies department at Holy Cross College in Massachusetts, said the Papal Letter avoids hard questions about the criteria used to determine definitive scripture parts. According to Laffey, the church has not resolved any new explanations for why she, and others, are denied entrance into priesthood. Sister Theresa Kan, president of the Leadership Conference of Women in the United States, told the Los Angeles Times that “we cannot as women access to decision making without ordination.’’ The progress that has been made depends on the individual parish. Some churches allow females to serve as cantors, lectors and \"extraordinary ministers’’ (disseminators of the Eucharist). Some catholic feminists say they do not feel the current positions women can hold in the church suffice their “callings.” Sister Susan Maloney of Sisters of the Holy Name, said in an L.A. Times interview that she feels that these advancements are not enough and the church suppresses “spirit-led vocations because of its incapacity to deal with women equally.” In his letter, the pope addressed what he calls the “dangers of feminism.” “In the name of liberation from male domination women must not appropriate to themselves male characteristics contrary to their own feminine originality.” The pope also stressed that a woman’s identity emerges from her relationship with a man. Some feminists agree that the movement toward complete equality has remained static because two far-reaching problems. First, traditional structures within the church limit what a clergy member can say or do on specific issues. In April of 1988 the National Corference of Catholic Bishops (N.C.C.B.) released “Partners in Ministry of Redemption.” an extensive examination into women’s roles in the church. According to Time Magazine, 75,000 women in the diocese were polled so that the bishop could deliver a fair report. Approved by 380 bishops, it supported more female involvement with the church and further investigations into women in the priesthood. Yet, the report stated, “The church is not free to depart from tradition.” Pat Reif, who heads a masters program on feminist spirituality at Los Angeles Immaculate Heart College told the New York Times that she was “astonished and very grateful” for the bishop’s report, but said, “it seems to me the bishops on the committee are pretty sympathetic to what women want but their hands are tied.” The other reason why developments have staggered have to do with what Georgia Masters Keighthey, a Catholic feminist calls the ministers’ power. In America magazine, Keighthey attributes the problem to the lack of a “definitive judgment on what constitutes equality.” According to Keighthey, the paradox is this: the Catholic Church calls women to be active members through teaching and involvement in church government but does not give them decision-making powers. Women’s participation in church activities is decided at the local levels. No one has any recourse beyond that of the pastor — and the bishop rarely intervenes, she said. Despite the authority that priests hold, Keighthey says that because of the influx of volunteers the identity of the priests is blurred. She said she believes the ability of priests to instruct and counsel is a form of power, one she said they would like to keep. The local catholic community feels that change is imminent. “I do envision that in the church of tomorrow women will play a greater role in the sacramental rights,” said Mariarty. He attributes this to the growing numbers of female theologians and the Vatican’s own push for more decision-making powers for women. In a time when priests are in high demand, it is not altogether suprising, said Maratto, that the church is taking a broader stand on giving women more active roles in the church. He added that the church has always “looked at the practical realities” facing it. Bishops will be releasing their final draft. On Women’s Roles in the Catholic Church, in November. Some catholic feminists fear that a written document may hinder further development within the church. Maratto disagrees, saying that the Bishop’s draft is “not an inflexible statement — it has the possibility of process.” Presently, catholic nuns and feminists are lobbying for more reforms to be included in the November 1989 final document on women’s roles in the Catholic church.",
