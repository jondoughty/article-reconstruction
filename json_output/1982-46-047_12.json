Ghmy Ftai, Pieaidant of the CaMfomia branch of NOW, gave an npdnU on the ERA at the Arroyo Grande Woman’s Community Center Wednesday, Jan. 13 as part of her ERA Mobilization Campaign. 1110 Mobilization Cam-padgn is to prove the \"ERA is not dea<L\" she said. Frat said the ERA has only six months to get three more states to join the ratification effort. Thsre are 16 states that haven’t ratified the ERA. Of these 16, ei^t didn’t ratify the 19th Amendment until after 1960. According to Frat, ratification in Florida, Oklahoma, North Carolina and Virginia looks hopeful. In Florida, a state-wide rampatgn has been put into effect, said Frat. NOW has placed national offices up and'down the coast. Last time a vote was taken the ERA was defeated by two votes. This time, Frat said, NOW is taking a different campaign aiqiroach. She said Florida has a lot of retired persons. So the campaign is showing that retiml women receive only $3,000 a year for Social Security benefits whereas the man reosivs $6,600. This strategy is causing the retired citizens to ban together, she said. NOW has also established two Hispanic offices where the literature being distributed is in Spanish. Florida looks the most positive, she said. *\"niey will be voting on the issue very soon as the legislature is in session,’’ she said. Oklahoma held a test vote on Jan. 13, Frat said. We weren’t ready tor ths vote,” she said. The vote came out four short. The canqmign there will continue, she said. We should see another vote in a couple weeks,” she added. In Illinois. NOW is trying to test Um three-fifths rule that was established for the approval of the ERA. She said that there has always been a majority approvaL but the \"problem hiw bean getting the three-fifths majority.” Frat arid she is confident that North Carolina will ratify the amendment. The only problem she sees there is that the legislature doesn’t meet until June. Mississippi.” she said. is a lost cause but the campaign will continue there. They are just too conservative.” Virginia ns the only state of the 16 that held elec-' tiods this year. Frat said she thinks this is a benefit. The elected Democratic lieutenant goverqor is the .deciding vote. Shé expects when the vote comes up in the next few weeks it will be pro ERA. In California, money and support is being raised in an effort to persuade the legislatures of those 16 states to approve the amendment. Frat said California has raised the most money for thè NOW organization. Some of the money has gone to sending memore to unratified states.",
