    "article_text": "The furnaces in the Cal Poly glassblowing lab line up against the wall like square, squat animals, roaring and glowing an eerie orange. As a student slides open a door to collect a lump of white-hot molten glass on the end of his blowpipe, intense heat pours out into the lab and warms the damp, early morning air~ of an overcast day.\ti For the beginning students of Art 242, it's “Smoothie Day,\" according to glassblowing teacher George Jercich. If the ' students have suC(:eeded in blowing a drinking glass or cup, they get to try them out by drinking smoothies, a drink con-, taining ice cream and fruit. It's an incentive, said Jercich. “No glass, no smoothie.\" For the advanced students, like Ralph Johnson and Bill Hedges.'it's time to practice and experiment with their glassblowing skills. Johnson, a 25-year-old crop science and poultry major, said he has been blowing glass for almost a year. What began as a side interest for him may become a professional career \"if farming doesnit pan out,\" said Johnson. One of his works, a \"slump bowl,\" is on display in the U.U. Galerie show,\"Selections '81.\" Johnson is presently working on his \"Confettie Series.\" \"1 got tired of making wine glasses,\" he said. \"I'm moving off into other territories.\" Describing his series idea as new wave, Johnson works with basic shapes of glass, and adds random places of color creating the \"confetti effect.” Johnson coats his blowpipe with a white liner before applying the molten glass, which turns the clear glass white. “It's a white background for me to paint on,\" said Johnson. One of Johnson's fellow students, Frank Zike, called him the class's \"most advanced student.\" “He's bean around here the longest,\" said Zike. “He's very serious about his work.\" Bill Hedges, 23, is an architecture student who has blown glass since last fall. He said he always enjoyed watching glassblowers and thought he would give it a try. Since that decision, he said he spends about four hours a week in the lab practicing at his hobby. “Why does an archie blow glass?” he asked. “Because it’s fun.” - Hedgee wpleig'iitht dhe of $he moet uBporUHt ing i* not to latehe gleiw «eoi teo feet. \"Tb* fliM4 /'jriiove fraetwei >t6o tnnu lur'iiiraiii ” r r fairly eet*bUsh*d«wrae ad|l*.a -fear years, aecordfa« t» «leedek. .... “The stodMii* ha^ed to make thi^ lab.“ said Jarckh, who le a profee>-\"' eiotial glaeehlowar. “It wa* a jpet buibflng it from the floor Tim atadk>, which ie located the pottery lab behind the Ki Uhmry. wae rooaotly enlarged I new sanding and i' •r After «! aMdeata ana art I dont draw hae etwtya.bajM friiii i for",
