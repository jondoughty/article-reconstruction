    "article_text": "I am outraged and 1 want something done! Upon calling Gulliver’s Travel in the U.U. to check on my spring break reservations to Mexico, I found that my flight, which I booked four months in advance, is no longer $221 but $310. •A 40 percent increase. •I was not told that my flight was not guaranteed. •I was not told to pay in advance to guarantee my price. •And, I found that the price quoted to me is not even good for flights booked for spring break! Now what? A student plans a vacation four months in advance and it is shot to pieces by the incompetence of the travel agency. I would think that since Gulliver’s Travel is part of the campus that they would be informative, knowledgable and work for the student benefit! I consider this extremely bad business. It baffles me that they are allowed to conduct this kind of poor customer service.",
