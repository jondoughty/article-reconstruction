    "article_text": "When a child whizzes down a playground slide he s learning physics, pure and simple. And when that child studies the shap>e formed by touching his ten fingertips together, he's observing an art basic—positive form and negative space. Discovering educational concepts in the physical environment, and designing effective learning environments was the topic of a slide-illustrated talk presented here Thursday by Dr. Anne Taylor, a professor of art education and architecture at the University of New Mexico. For the last 15 years Taylor has worked to \"marry education with architecture.\" That is, she considers architecture a medium to teach ideas. In her work designing schools, Taylor pays close attention to the learning needs of children, incorporating educational concepts into every aspect of the structure and the objects tlut fill it. In an optimal learning environment, Taylor said, the doors, lighting, furnishings, even the walls \"represent some of the concepts that conte right out of the curriculum that we teach from textbooks.” One illustration of this was a slide showing a snaall cubicle with mirrors on all four inside walls. It is an art center where children draw their likeness on the mirror by tracing over their image. Taylor said the children are able to draw with great detail this way and she found improvement in later artwork. The mirrored space also presents the difficult concept of infinity in a way children can see. Round forms are used as much as possible in the play areas Taylor designs because, she said, they permit eye contact and promote socialization. To implement some of her ideas would cost more than to build a standard elementary schoolroom, but Taylor also utilizes often overlooked learning tools that are part of any schoolroom. For example, thousands of dollars are spent every year on teaching aids that show children how various mechanical systems work. Taylor’s philosophy is to uncover some of those systems, such as plumbing and heating, so the students could learn by simply looking at the exposed pipe system. Another design that Taylor said has been very successful in two ways is a solar greenhouse. Children, who are egocentric, learned to nurture life outside themselves in the greenhouse. The circulating heat system, she added, provided a good comparison to teach ttem about their own circulatory systems. “Children learn a great many things by themselves,” Taylor said, “but the environment must be well designed and optimally provisioned.” I wu UsUiiiiig to • now« broadcast about our invohramant in Latin Amarica tbs othar night, whan I raaWaart that parhaps tha biggsst raaaon wa art down than is that wa simply don’t aaa the «mflict through tha ayes of those who ^va in tha region. Our administration does not understand that tha ptoblams in Latin America atom from the desire of an oppressed people to win their ri^t to a fidl belly. This inability to view the world as others do causes obvious political pto-blsms. Our laadars seam unable to stay out of distant aituationa they do not. understand. But this problem also effects our personal life because of the blunders and assumptions ws make ' with lovers and frimds. Before we can.expect our leaders to view the world with a lass jaundiced eye we as individuals must have this ability ourselves. I don’t pretend to possess this ability to any great extant, but I remember one time when I did see the world through the eyesof a friend, I learned a valued lesson. It was the summer of 1976, and we were both working in an iron foundry in Loe Angolas. We worked on the pouring crew, transfaring the molton iron from a huge laddie into molds as big as a Volkswagan Bug. It was a hot. miaarahlaan^dangarous Job. Besidss Ilia tact we both hated our jobal my friend, and I had almost notUng in common; ha was black and from tha ghetto, I was from tha suburbs and was ths only Caucasian In tha plant. Wa had a good faisndahip baasd on our woifr. Wa iohad tog^hsr and worked wnl togathar, trying to make an ahnoat unbaarabls job a BtUs saaiar. But our friendship neves went outsids of ths irbn foundry. I was often confused by his attitudes on Ufa, and tho«^ I Ubsd him I was shocked to learn that he occasionally would pull a “stick up“ just to get some extra money. When he asked me for a ride home, one day, Lgot an opportunity to see the world as hie did. and to undmtand his views a little better. He lived in Compton, in a run-down, black neighborho^. ’There was a number of abandoned cars' in ths strwts, and garbage in the gutters. Hm homes looked old a^ worn out. As wa pulled Into his driveway ha recognixea my growing discomfort. “Now you know how I foal in Whitey's world, don’cha?\" ha said. I told him I couldn’t really know how he felt, but that I got the point. Thara eras not a whita faca around, and I Mt uncomfbrtabla. “Ya know, it woun’t ba too bad if it want fo tha tuba man.\" “What ths haD has talsvision got to do arith anything?’’ I askad incredulous- “Whsnsvar I turn on tha tuba I saa Whitey,” he said quistly, “Whitey alwajrs look good, nica clothaa. nice house, plenty o’ bread...” Ha gave nm a hard look, “you aaa any o’ that sUt around hare?” I watched in silence as he got out of the car. cloeed the door ami walked toward his house. Down ths stipat there was a Itttla girl plasring jump-ropa in front of a bumad-out building, an old lady draasad in rags carrying a grocery bag and a drunk sitting on the curb with his head between his knees. “No.” I said to myself as my fHsnd entered hie houae. “no. I don’t see any of that shit around here.” Author kUchool Wockslor /s a sonhr JoumoUam motor ond Mustang Daily staff writor. In response to Steven L. Rebuck’s letter “SUtus of the Sea Otter,” I would like to thank you, Mr. Rebuck, for enlightening me about those horrible, beastly critters known as the sea otter. With nearly 1,200 of those monsters swimming off the coast of California, I’m surprissd that more people haven’t been hurti Why, just look at how sneaky they are. TIm^ co-habitated with aU tte other marine animals for thousands of years just to get us off^ guard, than—bami—in 10 years they decimated our commercial shell fishing industryl Boy, they must be ravenous! I wonder how many abalone, crabs, and clams that Is per otter, per day?! ’They must be one big eating machine—a mouth, a stomach and a Rebuck! I’m worried, though. When they run out of shellfish, what’s next? Dogs? Small children? Surfers? Mr. Rebuck, you scare me. If you and our illustrious Secretary of the Interior James Watt ever got together, 1 doubt there would be much of interest left in California’s waters. I also doubt you have ev«- spent hours trying to hand feed a mariiie mammal that has been blinded and left to die by one of our commercial fishermen. If you would care to try it, or maybe would like to see some of the Dumy other atrocities inflicted by commercial fishermen, come with me some time to the California Marine, Mammal Rehabilitation Center—I think even you would be disgusted! Let’s hear it for “emotional outojes’’-they show we care.\tI I Coa^wred to moet etudants, I would considsr msrsalf well informed about avente and activities on and off campus that concsm atudants. Many students, though, know very little about what is going on, and raly on ths Daily to inform thsm. Unfortunately, I find that tha Daily covers moet events only after they have occurred, and then provides a tiiort and shaBow account of arhat hap-panad with no background or inaids information on tha event itself. I thought that the sariae of artidas on Poly Royal and last year’s coverage of Greek Week was not thorough enough to say the least, and there was no coverage of the Paao Robles air shoie with the “Blue Angds”. One of the Angela happened to ba a Cal Poly alumnus who could have been interviewed. I wish that the Daily could be more proactive in reporting events rather than reactive. Please report events and activitiss before they happen so that the students may be aware of upcoming events.",
