    "article_text": "According to Katherine Gill’s article about Michael Parenti’s presentation, Parenti argues that “the government has control over what is printed because the media is dependent on it for its sources of information.” Other than the fact that “the government” should be more clearly defined, it is almost impossible to argue with this statement. That is why I was humored, but not surprised, by Ted Holz’s arguments at the end of the article. It does not matter if “62 percent of the 1200 reporters and editors polled considered themselves liberal while 22 percent called themselves conservative” in the outdated 1989 poll of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Whether the journalists are liberal or conservative, the fact remains that information which the media gets from the government and relays to the public is biased by the government (Parenti used a perfect example with the Persian Gulf War). I am not sure if the article was poorly written and Ted was responding to a different part of Parenti’s presentation. I have been misquoted by the Daily before and recognize that this does happen. However, if Ted’s statements were in response to Parenti’s argument cited here, they are totally irrelevant. 'Ibd Holz, being the editor of a campus newspaper, should address the issues and be more professional with his position before he calls people “full of it.” Loners to the editor should be typed, less than 250 words and include the author's name, phono number and major or occupation. Loners may be edited for clarity, content or space limitations. Leners should be turned into the leners box in the Mustang Daily office.",
