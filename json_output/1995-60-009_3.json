    "article_text": "Noisy parties have kept the San Luis Obispo Police Department busy the first two weekends of the quarter. Police received over 90 noise complaints the first weekend, and over 60 more last weekend, said Chief Jim Gardiner. The overabundance of complaints is not a new problem for the police department. In fact, three years ago the city of San Luis Obispo, ASI and Cal Poly formed a collaborate program called Student Neighborhood Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.) to assist the Pclice department in responding to these calls. According to Gardiner, a SJ4A.P. team of two people help police handle routine noise complaints on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. “They are the first respondents to noise complaints,” Gardiner said. “The S.N.A.P. person is the first (contact) and should be treated seriously.” Once the team arrives at the scene, they have the authority to issue a verbal warning or a Disturbance Advisement Card (DAC) as a warning. A DAC is a 24-hour warning. If a second visit is made within 24 hours, a police officer may issue a noise citation, which could result in a fine of $80 to $100, Gardiner said. The person cited can also be billed for the officer’s time, he added. This amount may vary because of the time the officer spends at the cite but it averages about $50 an hour. Noise violations not only affect those living at the residence, but the landlords as well. The SLO City Council passed the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance around four years ago because of the high number of rentals, Gardiner said. With the ordinance, if two DACs are issued to a tenant within 60 days, the landlord is sent a nuisance letter describing the disturbances and the consequences the landlord will face if this continues. If a third DAC or citation is issued in the 60 days, the landlord will face criminal char- *We need absentee landlords to be more responsible,” Gardiner said. ”We really want to work with the property owners. But the issue is to get the disturbances to stop.” S.NA.P. member Ray FVigil-lana thinks the program is successful in stopping disturbances and in most cases people quiet down. *A lot of the people we talk to are real cooperative toward us,” FVigillana said. *We haven’t met much resistance.” Frigillana estimates that 90 percent of the noise disturbance calls are student-party related, and that SJ4A.P. has decreased police responses by about 50 percent. This gives police time to respond to more important calls. he said. ‘If they’re dealing with a loud party, they can’t apply themselves to more important issues,” Gardiner said. The program benefits students as well, Frigillana added. ‘It’s students talking to students to take care of the problem,” he said. ‘It gives them a chance to (avoid) a ticket. ‘An officer doesn’t have to give a warning,” he continued. ‘He can cite a person for the first call. I’d rather not see students get records — it could make it difficult for them to get a job in the future.” SJ4A.P. is always looking for people interested in joining, and is tidung applications at the ASI office, Frigillana said.",
