Cash prizes ranging from $50 to $200 are awarded to the top three entries, and the winners piece will be published by SLO Nightwriters. But, according to contest organizer Lynette Hamel, there’s a catch — each entry must begin ’vith the same sentence. Hamel said this year’s starter sentence is “The deal with a sweet one.” “The story that falls in between that first sentence and the last period,” Hamel said, “is up to you.” Shirley Powell, president of SLO Nightwriters, said the group was established in 1988 to provide marketing and development support for professional and amateur writers in the area. Club meetings are held on the second Monday of each month and are open to the public. During each meeting, a guest speaker addresses some aspect of writing, Powell said, such as publishing or scriptwriting. This month’s meeting will be held May 11 at the San Luis Obispo County Library at 7 p.m. Arianna Huffington, a published writer and wife of congressional candidate Michael Huffington, will be the guest speaker. Those interested in entering the contest may send a self-addressed stamped envelope to Writer’s Contest, do Lynette Hamel, 2324 Black Walnut Road, San Luis Obispo, 93405.",
