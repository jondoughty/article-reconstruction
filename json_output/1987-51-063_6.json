    "article_text": "Like it or not, the Student Senate is our Voice to the Administration. In their recent newsletter, ASI Times, they bragged about all the resolutions passed this year already. While the effectiveness of a senate can’t be measured by the number of resolutions passed, the kind of resolutions they discuss shows what they think is important. The most notable resolutions discussed in the senate so far have been one opposing Proposition 61, one asking the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce to let us retain our seat on their board, and two concerning “ASI Official Cards” which will let senators into all ASI events for free. Only one resolution, which formed a student committee to make recommendations on the use of lottery funds, even comes close to the most important job student leaders have: advocating the student point of view to the Administration. Though the senate is powerless to actually change university policy, it can make recommendations and lobby for Administration action. For example, last year the senate got business hours extended at student support services offices and looked into putting more bike lanes on campus. Issues such as teacher shortages and curriculum changes, and ideas to make graduating in four years possible have yet to be discussed. It would be nice to see this year’s senate put aside political squabbles and do the job they were elected to do: represent student needs and fight for them to be met.",
