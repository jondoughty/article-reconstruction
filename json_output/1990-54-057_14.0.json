    "article_text": "FREMONT (AP) — Bill Henin and Susan Davis exchanged wedding vows in front of family and friends, but instead of standing at the altar, they were thigh-deep in a steamy, 110-degree hot tub. “We wanted it to be something special we can look back on and giggle about,” Heflin said about the Saturday ceremony under a gazebo behind his home about 25 miles southeast of San Francisco. Instead of a tuxedo, the 39-year-old Heflin wore a suit coat, T-shirt and cut-off suit pants. The bride donned a cream-colored blouse, a flowered hairpiece and the bottom half of a silk sari over Lycra shorts. “1 wanted to be formal from the waist up, informal from the waist down,” said Davis, 35. Adding to the atmosphere were fragrant gardenias floating on top of the swirling hot tub water, rock music and the wedding march daringly played on a harmonica by one of Davis’ daughters, 9-year-old Jamie. Thé approximately 40 relatives and friends attending the wedding went with the flow, so to speak. “I thought that maybe he’d lost his marbles,” said Fay Bryan of Oregon, the bride’s mother. “I think it’s going to be great for her though.” Davis agreed, with one reservation: “Yes, it was great, except for the part where I almost fell over” in the freshly waxed hot tub.",
