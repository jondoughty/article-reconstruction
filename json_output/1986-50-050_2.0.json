    "article_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States acknowledged Monday that Iran may have acted within traditional naval warfare\trules\tin\tstopping\tand searching an American merchant ship near the Persian Gulf to determine if it was carrying arms for Iraq. A final judgment on how to respond\tto\tthe\tincident\twas withheld\tuntil\tthe\tAmerican\tambassador\tto\tthe\tUnited Arab Emirates completes his questioning of the capuin of the President Taylor, and other facu are assessed.

Kalb’s sutement seemed to represent an effort by the Reagan administration to avoid a flareup with the fundamentalism Moslem regime in Tehran, which is listed by the department as a supporter of terrorism.

However, the spokesman did say in a statement that a belligerent nation traditionally has \"certain rights” under the rules of naval warfare, to find out whether neutral shipping is being used to provide contraband to its enemy. Meanwhile, G. Quincy Lumb-sden Jr., the U.S. ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, was sent to Fujaira to meet with the freighter’s captain, Robert Reimann. The ships were there “to prevent anything other than what happened,\" Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger told reporters at a breakfast meeting at the Pentagon. “The boarders left very quietly after an hour, an hour-and-a-half. There wasn’t any need for the kind of naval protection that the ship was seeking.” The Conolly and the Boone were near the Persian Gulf, but too far north to prevent the boarding, and yet “they were close enough that they could have prevented the Iranians from taking that ship under tow or forcing it to an Iranian port,” said a Navy source, insisting on anonymity.",
