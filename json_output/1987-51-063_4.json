It’s our first league win here in three years.” A weekend split did not seem out of the question, however. Pomona entered the contest at 1-3. But Saturday’s battle turned out to be almost as tough as Friday’s. Despite leading by as much as six points, the Mustangs could not put Pomona away. Pomona used three-point baskets to pull ahead, 55-54, with 1:36 remaining. The next minute’s events probably hurt the Mustangs as much as what happened right before the buzzer. With 1:20 remaining, Parker was fouled and sent to the line for a pair of shots. He missed both. A second later, he picked up his fourth foul. Parker did not last much longer, fouling out with 35 seconds left. Tony Theisen buried both free throws to give Pomona a three-point ad- vantage. Poly’s designated three-point shooter, Mark Otta, then entered the game. Otta’s baseline jumper from behind the three-point arc fell in to tie the game with 15 seconds remaining. However, Pomona wasted little time bringing the ball back up the court. With two seconds left and the crowd of 1,758 thundering, a wide-open Adam Sacks nailed a 21-foot jumper. Poly’s Mike Wintringer tried in vain to call timeout, but the buzzer went off before the referees noticed him. “We probably should have called a timeout (after Otta’s basket) to set up a defense,” said Season. “That was my fault.” Parker broke out of his slump Saturday, making 11 of 14 shots for 23 points. Mike Wintringer’s deadly outside shooting produced 12 points, while Chambers managed only eight. The Mustangs, however, shot only 29 percent from the free throw line. Bill Dobbs hit two three-pointers to lead Pomona with 11 points. Terry Stevens scored 10 and Darron Suttle had nine.",
