    "article_text": "BEIJING ijVP) — China Thursday called human rights reports on oppression in Tibet \"groundless,” and urged the United Nations to Ignore them. The United Nations has compiled testimony from 12 private human rights groups to be presented to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, meeting in Geneva this week. The commission is discussing China’s human rights record in Tibet for the first time. The report details a variety of abuses, including systematic torture and ill-treatment of detainees, many of whom are held without trial; close-range shootings of at least 60 pro-independence protestors since 1987; and forced atertions and sterilization of women. But Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said, “The accusations made by some non-govemmental agencies like Amnesty International on the issue of Tibet are groundless.”",
