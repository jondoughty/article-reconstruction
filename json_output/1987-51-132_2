    "article_text": "ASI has begun soliciting corporate sponsorships in order to bring quality programs to Cal Poly at less cost to the student. ASI controller Andy Higgins said the corporate sponsorships are a good deal for everyone. \u201cBig companies find it tough to reach the college crowd,\u201d he said, \u201cso corporations are willing to do it (underwrite programs) to get in touch with the students.\u201d What the sponsorships mean to students is more for their dollar, according to Higgins. \u201cStudent fees needn\u2019t be raised to support programs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe (ASI) might put out $10-15,000 for a program, but this way we put out around $800.\u201d The most recent corporate-sponsored event at Cal Poly was the Coors Comedy Commandos. With Coors paying for the act and help- ing with promotions, Higgins said it cost students only $2 for the show. If ASI did everything, it would have had to charge students between $9 and $12. \u201cWe essentially made money on that event, rather than subsidizing it with student funds,\u201d said Higgins. Another corporate-sponsored event was the spring quarter ASI film series, which was underwritten by General Motors. \u201cGeneral Motors got a plug on the promotional material,\u201d said Higgins, \u201cand they got a day to display some of their cars in the University Union.\u201d Higgins said the biggest problem with corporate sponsorships is that ASI must avoid competing with the university for funds. \u201cThe administration is concerned if we\u2019re soliciting businesses that aren\u2019t our business to approach,\u201d said Higgins, mentioning companies such as Hewlett-Packard that donate equipment and funds to universities. \u201cThere are some gray areas on who we can approach. We haven\u2019t hammered out a formal policy yet.\u201d Higgins added that ASI is picky about whc it gets for the sponsorships. \u201cThe company must have a good name,\u201d he said. \u201cThe administration was concerned with Coors coming because of the alcohol issue, but it was very well done and they never once pushed drinking beer.\u201d Higgins said that in the future corporate sponsorship will be a great way to bring top-notch speakers and entertainment to Cal Poly. \u201cIt can cost us up to $20,000 to put on some shows,\u201d he said. \u201cThis way we minimize our risk, make some money and get good quality programs.\u201d",
