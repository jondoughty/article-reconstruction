    "article_text": "The morning of Nov. 1 is like none other throughout the year, at least out at the Horse Unit’s Breeding Barn. On this day, the barn is overrun by a slew of camped-out students, making the stone-floored building look more like a BASS ticket center than Cal Poly’s equine reproduction unit. But the tickets these students are waiting for aren’t for any concert, but for the chance to enroll as one of 45 students in Animal Science 131, Beginning Western Riding. “I thought I was going to be the only one out there at 3 o’clock, but there was already a line by the time I got to the bam,” said Jamie Ramirez, a home economics senior, thinking back on that cold morning. The class, only offered during winter quarter, fills up each year, despite a $150 lab fee. Instructors Roger Hunt and Gene Armstrong have more than 45 years of combined experience teaching and working with horses. This class has three sections, Tuesday and Thursday from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m. to noon; Monday, Wednesday, Friday 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.; and Monday, Wednesday, Friday 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The three-unit class includes a textbook, homework assignments and hands-on experience. “A lot of people do things for money,” said Armstrong, a 1966 Cal Poly animal science graduate. “But this is something I like to do. I’ve been around horses all of my life. I can never remember not being around livestock. “Beginning Western Riding provides the opportunity to gain horse experience, which can be used in other animal science classes or just for pleasure,” Armstrong said. The class teaches beginners and those with limited experience techniques for grooming, riding skills, care and feed-Scc RIDING CLASS, page 8 Late Registration for students taking Evening-Only Classes will be available January 28 thru February 3 at all three sites.

At the present time, compiled student evaluations of Cal Poly faculty are not made available to the student body. All faculty members are required to be evaluated periodically. Non-tenured faculty are evaluated more often and the evaluations can have an effect on their permanence at Cal Poly. The eSU system allow schools to choose evaluation styles Individually. Many faculty feel that evaluations are only for the guidance of the Instructor. Several years ago, Associated Students Inc. brought the idea of a student evaluation team to the faculty. The evaluations would have been available to all students in the library. The idea was rejected. The U.U. and You is compiled by Peter Hartlaub and Hans Hess on Mondays in the University Union.

Along with the lab fee, stu dents are required to have :i riding helmet and their own health insurance. Having youi own tack (a saddle and riding pads) is recommended because the ones the horses come with aren’t in the best condition, Armstrong said. The horses come from Ken nedy Meadows Pack Station near Lake Isabella in Southern California. Through classes at Cal Poly the horses are fed, vaccinated and exercised. The costs are greatly minimized by having students perform many of these tasks. Armstrong said everyone benefits from the arrangement — Kennedy Meadows, the horses and the students in the riding class and in animal science classes. “This class is not just for beginners. There are different horses with different temper-ments and different people with different temperments too, and it’s good experience learning how to work with all kinds,” Armstrong said.",
