    "article_text": "‘Tis the Christmas season, and nothinfi tops the holiday more than the scent of a fresh-cut Christmas tree. For the third year in a row, students can do their Christmas tree shopping on campus. The natural resource management department’s enterprise project has about 550 Monterey pine trees and some pre-cut red fir trees to ch(X)se from. The tree faiTn was planted in 1984 and opened for business four years lattm with a stock of 220 trees. Last year, tree sales topped the 300 mark, and this year the department is hoping for more, said Mike DeLasaux, a NRM instructional technician. DeLasaux said enterprise projects are available through the Sch(X)l of Agi'iculture. The program, which is open to anyone, enables students to develop projects and experiments. He said the students must provide a proposal that outlines the project and its expenses and shows a complete budget statement. If it is approved, the Cal Poly Foundation supplies the start-up money. DeLasaux said the tree farm is a unique enterprise project because it’s managed by the Cal Poly Logging Sports Team. It is one of the few projects that Environmental engineering senior Dave Schinski checks out a Poly-growth Christmas tree. The NRM department and logging team plan to sell more than 550 fresh-cut trees this holiday season. a club team manages. He said the projects are usually developed and run by a few students who split the profits. Craig Linguist, a natural resource management senior and member of the logging club team, said the club needs about 812,000 to host the American Western Forestry Conclave in This is a major logging event which will bring forestry schools such as Humboldt State and Oregon State to Cal Poly to compete in logging competitions. Last year, Poly placed second in the AWFC in Colorado. From paj>c 1 Linguist, who also managed the tree farm for three yeaj’s, said “Rarely do we make a profit.” He said some of the money is used to pay back the debt to the Foundation. DeLasaux said each quarter three students sign up for this project. They work on the tree farm doing maintenance duties. He said the students are in demand throughout the summer growing season when they must shape the trees four or five times, as needed. On the last day of this quarter, nomination fomis for the Distinguished Teachers of the year are due. Each year Cal Poly students are asked to nominate faculty members for the Distinguished Teachers Award. The award, which Ix'gan in the 1963-64 school year, is the university’s way of recognizing and encouraging faculty members for excellence in teaching. “The purpose (of the award) is to encourage g(K)d teaching,” said Harvey Greenwald, mathematics professor and chairman of the Ilistinguished Teachers Award Committee.
