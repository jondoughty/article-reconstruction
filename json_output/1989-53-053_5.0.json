    "article_text": "These students had taken up every inch of the UU including Bishopâ€™s I.ounge where 1 normally study. 1 approached the UU manager to inquire about a room for studying, and she told me that every room was occupied by high school students, and the only room available was occupied by a person using the computer. Tell me, is it fair that we pay S51 a quarter and S204 per year on University Union fees not to have a room to study in when there is a special group? The UU management should rethink its policies when this event occurs.",
