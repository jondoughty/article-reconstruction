    "article_text": "Before addressing Jeff Coffman’s attempt at an argument (Jan, 22 commentary, “M.L. King undeserving of honor”), it may be pertinent for us to remember the words of a French philosopher who said: “No man is strong unless he bears within his character antitheses strongly marked,” This means even the greatest men have weaknesses they wrestle with. Martin Luther King Jr. was foremost a man. He was not perfect, but his accomplishments overshadow whatever faults his detractors will allege. King graduated from Morehouse College with honors at 19, earned a second bachelor’s degree from Crozier and was at the top of his class by age 22, flew through the master’s and Ph.D. programs at the prestigious Boston University to earn his doctorate at 26. He also founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was its first president, led the nation’s largest activist gathering ever, wrote five books, published more than 60 articles, had more than 3,000 speaking engagements and was the youngest winner ever of the Nobel Peace Prize. King’s accomplishments were cut short by his assassination at 39, but in those years, he single-handedly revolutionized American social and political life. Coffman constructed a three-stage scaffolding upon which I can hang his argument. Two criticisms don’t address aspects of King’s public life and moral philosophy, which ideally should be the only debatable subjects. They instead resort to speculations about King’s personal life and to guilt by association by giving his aides the hackneyed communist label. A third argument contains quotes so badly misconstrued they reveal Coffman’s malicious intent. As to King’s alleged extramarital affairs, Coffman erred in stating he should be classified with Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker because, unlike these ministers. King isn’t alive to deny or affirm the charges, he had a public life apart from his Christian ministry and should be judged on the basis of that, and finally. King’s widow and children firmly believe in his moral goodness on this count. Coffman targets some of King’s aides as associates of communism. It is not illegal nor necessarily un-American to associate with individuals who have communist ties; nevertheless, King was always anticommunist. He said, “Communism forgets that life is individual.” And King and the SCLC were both cleared in the FBI’s report to President Johnson. As to Coffman’s erroneous perception of King’s moral philosophy, his blatant misuse of quotes from “I Have a Dream” is despicable. The “whirlwinds of revolt” statement and all others King made of that nature show when he mentioned violence, he was only stating the fact of its already present existence — for example, in Watts or Detroit. King never condoned rioting or violence of any form. His notion of power was bound up inextricably in a doctrine of love and intrinsic unity of the human race. King deserves to be recognized each year because he was our first national leader to envision an America in which all of us thrive harmoniously. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and other American presidents were great men who rendered priceless contributions to our way of life, but their visions were exclusive of some, not inclusive of all. Because King recognized all of America so completely and unconditionally, it seems right the people of the United States recognize him and the truth of his message in the same spirit. uselessness\tand\tembarassment. Where\tdo\tyou come from? Why should you be proud of who you are? These questions\tI’m\tsure\tmost\tpeople inter- nally ask themselves, and most can answer for themselves with almost no hesitation. Except the Afro-American. When Africans were sold into\tslavery\tand brought to North\tAmerica, they were\tcut off\tfrom the knowledge of\ttheir\town kind, cut off from the knowledge of their own language, religion and past culture until the African-American was the only race on earth that had absolutely no knowledge of its true identity. The African-American “Negro” was invented in this country by the frequent trips massa made to the slave quarters to cool down his burning libido. This weakening of the bond between the Negro of America and the African caused prejudice and hatred among this group that was enslaved as a whole. After several generations, when almost all that was African about the black man was either killed off or forgotten, massa began to teach his uncouth animals they did indeed come from Africa — where they were plucked from the jungle, swinging from vines like monkeys and killing tigers with their bare hands — and were saved from the uneducated, uncultured primitive societies of Africa. And when they wanted to worship God, they could not even think of worshipping a god in their likeness. God is black? Nonsense. Could never be. The black man eventually would do anything to be like the white man — bleach his skin, straighten his hair, lighten his eyes — because the white man was seen as superior to the black man. The sad part about all this is not only did whites feel this way, but many blacks felt the same way, too. Being lighter complexioned meant a black could “pass” for being white. Being black was a curse. When a young boy by the name of Malcolm Little, who later would become known to the world as Malcolm X, was in the eighth grade, a section on black history was introduced in his history class. He was discouraged to find the entire history of black Americans was exactly one paragraph long. The entire history of a people who had been in this country for more than 300 years was one paragraph. This experience has been shared by many blacks across the nation when they were young, including myself. Imagine the feeling that as a people your culture had accomplished nothing. Many Americans know nothing of the accomplishments of Louis Lattimer, Dr. Charles R. Drew, George Washington Carver and Benjamin Banneker. 1 know I never read, in a state-issued text, much more than a few pages of scribble about the accomplishments of these and other black Americans. Growing up without a sense of pride in who you are is difficult. Being denied access to the heritage of the black man, many blacks grow up thinking they are little more than what they saw on television just 10 years ago — television where blacks were portrayed as pimps, street whores and hustlers, killers and criminals. People — especially young, impressionable black and white youths — believe what is seen on television. Ignorance of peoples’ cultures is one problem of all Americans, We as a country are so ethnocentric we have created a Berlin Wall of sorts by not allowing others’ ideas to penetrate our little world. This “Berlin W'all” is even more opposing than the actual one in Germany was, for this wall is of the mind. Physical barriers are easy to overcome; mental barriers take much more of an earnest effort to rise above. So the purpose of Black History Month is not to force blackness onto everyone who might cross the path of a parade or speech, but to enhance the knowledge of a culture that was and still is denied to its people. In order for people to respect us, and indeed to respect ourselves, we must know who we are and where we come from. One month out of a year isn’t going to erase 371 years of denial, but it must start somewhere. And to my brothers and sisters. Black History Month for us must go on year-round, so we may continue to educate our unknowing brothers and sisters, and bring to them the light of knowledge, and a ray of hope for the future.

After winning eight straight Division II national titles, the Cal Poly head coach for women’s cross country said that his team is one of the top 10 programs in the United States. Harter said this success could not have been possible without the right recruiting. “I think the reason we’ve had successful recruiting is that we have gone after a certain type of athlete that fits our personality as a coaching staff,” Harter said. “When you have both the athlete and the coach on the same wavelength, and have the same drive to be successful, then most likely the two of them are going to be compatible and work together at achieving the goals for the athlete.” Harter, who believes he is the first Division II coach named to the Olympic team, said that he has always been motivated to do the best job he can. “Being a democratic type of presenter as a coach makes for a lot more work,” Harter said. “It’s a lot easier to be just totally autocratic.” Not only is Harter concerned about the athlete on the track, but off the track as well. “1 think rm still the same guy, I just get an extra pair of sweats that say U.S.A. on the back. “I was taught ever since I was young to — whatever I do — do a good job,” he said. Harter, who is in his 11th year coaching at Cal Poly, takes a humanistic approach to coaching, which makes it more difficult for him. that is one of *he reasons for our success,” he said. Becoming an assistant coach for the 1992 Olympics has not changed his responsibilities at Cal Poly, or himself. “I’m still the same guy, I just get an extra pair of sweats that say U.S.A. on the back,” he said. Harter’s position as an Olympic coach has already started. He has such responsibilities as paperwork and phone contacts. He will also travel to international competitions in an attempt to establish solid relations between athletes and the 1992 Olympic coaching staff. “So when we go to Spain, we’re one solid identity. They know who we are, we know who they are, and we’re comfortable with each other,” Harter said. After the Olympics, Harter plans to continue coaching at Cal Poly, even though he has had many other offers. “There are very few jobs I’d even consider,” he said. “We (my family and 1) are very content here.” Harter finds Cal Poly to be a beautiful place to recruit, due to the unique blend of academics first and athletics second — a philosophy that is not necessarily practiced in a lot of universities across the United States. Bernard Strickmeier, coordinator of the single subject credential program that trains students to teach at the high school level. Strickmeier, a mathematics professor, said the state Commission on Teacher Credentials sets a limit on the number of hours that can be required for a clear credential. Therefore, he said, increasing requirements is difficult. “Whenever you increase requirements in one area, you have to reduce in other areas,” he said. “You can’t just add hours and hours.” Bernard Troy, coordinator of the master’s degree program in computer-based education, said Cal Poly could “ask students to get better in technology,” but that they also could be asked to get better in a lot of areas. “Teaching students to deal with multi-ethnic and bilingual groups are priorities, too,” he said. “Schools and teachers also have to meet needs they never had before, such as dealing with drugs, abused kids and latch-key kids. We could demand a lot more of everything.” “There’s a lot of things you have to balance, and there’s also a practical limit,” said Strickmeier. “You don’t want to make the program too much of a hassle by having students needing to spend five years or more to graduate.” “We’re doing a pretty good job,” said Ken Palmer, interim head of the education department. “1 feel our students are coming out with enough skill to appropriately integrate technology in the classroom.” Lucy Falcon, currently working toward her master’s degree in education at Cal Poly, disagrees. Falcon received a liberal studies degree from Cal Poly in 1986. She said that the liberal studies program, which is designed to prepare students to teach at the elementary school level, didn’t train her enough to use computers in the classroom. “In my first year of teaching, I had a computer in my room and I didn’t know what to do with it,” she said. “Now I’m learning — two years after I started teaching. “Two (computer) courses is adequate for the clear credential, but one should be required for undergraduates,” said Falcon. It would have been more of a use to me and given me more understanding on how to use it in theclassroofn.” Nulman said another problem is that no one in the teacher education faculty has really discussed what computer applications are appropriate for classroom instruction. Nulman added that most committees, such as the single- and multiple-subject credential committees, have never addressed the issue. “There’s no perception that there’s a need for change,” Nulman said. “The people responsible have no interest in changing it, so they leave it up to the individual teachers to do what they want with their courses.” Nulman said this lack of consensus leads to a lack of consistency in what is taught to the students. “Two\tstudents will\ttake\tthe same class with different teachers, and\tthe\ttwo will\tcome\tout with very different levels of skill to use technology in K-12 classrooms,” he said. Jeff Weit, a teacher at Shan-don Elementary School and currently working for his clear credential at Cal Poly, agrees. “There are major differences between\tED\t380X classes,\tand the difference is in the instructor,” said Weit, who is taking ED 380X with Professor Pat Mulligan. “I have friends who have taken the class with other instructors and said it was a joke. They’d just review basic software\tfor\tApples,\tIBMs\tand Macintoshs, and after an hour everyone would go home and get an A. “One friend of mine said to me, ‘1 took the class and they told me 1 was computer literate, but there was no way 1 would have felt comfortable even turning on a computer in a classroom.’ ” Palmer, who has served as department head since Jan. 1, said no one has complained to him about differences in how ED 380X is taught. “This is completely new to me,” he said. Palmer said that each course has an outline that summarizes common learning objectives and that each instructor must base how he or she teaches that course on that outline. “If students have concerns about how someone is teaching a class. I’d hope they’d share them with me or share them with the instructor,” he said. All work on the new offices and the police station was done by Plant Operations. “This is all in-house work,” said Brug of the remodeled warehouse. Plant Operations ' provides maintenance and does small construction for the campus. The job was to remodel an existing warehouse. Drafting Technician Rex Wolf, a 1978 Cal Poly architecture graduate, was put in charge of developing the plans for the project. “Normally something like this you would see done by contractor,” said Wolf. The warehouse was vacated by Foundation, which moved to a new building near the poultry unit. The project took about four months to complete and cost Public Safety $40,000. The rest of the building still exists as a warehouse and is being used by the housing department for storage. There wasn’t “a whole lot to start with,” said Plant Operations carpenter Leonard Hall. Hall and co-workers Clancy Armstrong and Pat Griffen did most of the “master work,” said Brug. All the plumbers, carpenters, electricians and others from Plant Operations did all of the work, making this one of the campus’s biggest projects. The landscaping around the building was done by Cal Poly groundskeepers. There are plans to install rest rooms and more mezzanine space for storage in the old warehouse. cessfui, it may become an annual event, said Hughes. The HRM concentration is still relatively new and small,” said Bradbury. “And 1 think it was important to bring these businessmen to students, and also to inform other business students what the concentration is about.” Free to all students, the conference focuses on personnel relations and will feature three keynote speakers and six panel discussions, led by Cal Poly alumni and businesspeople from throughout California. Jan Duffy, professor of business law at Cal Poly, will discuss legal issues in the 1990s. Harry Wilson, vice president of administration in the Applied Technology Division of Litton Industries, will examine cor- porate restructuring. James Linhart, district sales manager in Southern California for Eastman Kodak, will cover the history and potential of human resource management. Workshop topics will include innovative benefits for the 1990s; office politics:\tmanaging the workplace; employee stress; how to get the most out of employees; the legalities of hiring and firing; and the growing pains of expanding businesses. Conference participants will include representatives from San Luis Obispo County, Dart Marketing Associates, Seagate Technology, Sun Microsystems and J.C. Penney. The final day to sign up is Wednesday in the Dean’s Office, located in the Business Administration and Education Building Couple has ‘wet wedding;’ exchanges vows in Jacuzzi FREMONT (AP) — Bill Henin and Susan Davis exchanged wedding vows in front of family and friends, but instead of standing at the altar, they were thigh-deep in a steamy, 110-degree hot tub. “We wanted it to be something special we can look back on and giggle about,” Heflin said about the Saturday ceremony under a gazebo behind his home about 25 miles southeast of San Francisco. Instead of a tuxedo, the 39-year-old Heflin wore a suit coat, T-shirt and cut-off suit pants. The bride donned a cream-colored blouse, a flowered hairpiece and the bottom half of a silk sari over Lycra shorts. “1 wanted to be formal from the waist up, informal from the waist down,” said Davis, 35. Adding to the atmosphere were fragrant gardenias floating on top of the swirling hot tub water, rock music and the wedding march daringly played on a harmonica by one of Davis’ daughters, 9-year-old Jamie. Thé approximately 40 relatives and friends attending the wedding went with the flow, so to speak. “I thought that maybe he’d lost his marbles,” said Fay Bryan of Oregon, the bride’s mother. “I think it’s going to be great for her though.” Davis agreed, with one reservation: “Yes, it was great, except for the part where I almost fell over” in the freshly waxed hot tub.",
