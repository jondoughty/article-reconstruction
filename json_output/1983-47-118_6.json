The firat game was a hard-fought, 10-inning bout, with Brian Darling doubling in the ninth to keep the Mustangs in the game tied at 6. Chapman came out in the top of the tenth to bang in 6 runs, none of which Poly could answer. The second game was a completely different story. Senior Bruce Carrico had one of the finest games of his career so far, going 3-f«'-4, including a double and 5 RBIs. Lambert uiqied 1^ batting average and ended a sinall slump, while Darling also had a hot time at the plate For the seniors, including Carrico, Saturday could have been their last game, depending on the outcome of a UC Riyerside makeup game at press time Sunday. Should Mverside lose, the Mustangs will have a chance to {day spoQers Monday at 8 p.m. in San Luis Obispo StacUum in the Highlanders’ attempts to nialte post-season play. If UC Riverside comes to play Monday, the team will stay for the rescheduled Tuesday double header beginning at 11 a.mi",
