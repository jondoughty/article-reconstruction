    "article_text": "Hockey is one of the most exiting sports to watch, live or on clevision, yet last weekend’s Ml-Star game was the first network TV appearances by the ^Hl. in years. What’s the pro-)lem? For starters, the pace of a iockey game doesn’t lend itself 0\tnetwork television. You can’t ut away for a block of three ommercials, because it kills the ace of the game. Each team on-y gets one timeout the entire ame, so that can’t be relied ipon for a consistent commercial break. On cable networks such as Prime Ticket, they’ll take a break after, say, an offside call and before the face-off to resume play, but they won’t cut away for more than a 30-second spot. Even 30 seconds is too long, because like 1\tsaid before, the pace of the game is ruined. .‘\\nother problem with the NHL is that the league is managed poorly. Hockey seemed on the verge of something big a few years back when they were on ESPN, but when the contract expired, NHL President John Ziegler decided not to give ESPN a contract renewal. Instead, the contract was awarded to TSN, a j sports cable network that is limited to the Northeast area of “ United States. So the NHL ■\tcoverage is limited to TSN on a national basis, and the league : has to depend on local cable outfits like Prime Ticket on a regional basis. Another unfortunate aspect that may or may not hurt the NHL is that there seems to be a j lack of broadcasters competent enough to keep up with the fast pace of a hockey game. A1 ■\tMichaels of ABC did a good job at the Olympics — you remember, he was the guy who : said “Do you believe in miracles?” when the USA team beat the Soviet Union in 1980 — but then, he does a good job with every sport he calls. I didn’t get a chance to see the All-Star game last Sunday, but I’ve been told that Marv Albert wasn’t so hot. He left a lot of dead air, I guess. Say the NHL did sign a contract with a major network, '^'hat if it was CBS? I don’t even want to think about Brent Musberger calling a hockey game. Hopefully, in the next couple years NBC will pick up about 12 games to test it out. And if it works, by the time the NHL expands near the end of the 1990s, we could have full-scale national television coverage of hockey.",
