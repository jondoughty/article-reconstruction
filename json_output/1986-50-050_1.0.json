    "article_text": "The future of a three-year-old plan to construct a co-generation facility at Cal Poly will be decided in the next several months, the executive dean said Friday. Douglas Gerard said that the Allied Signal Corporation of Connecticut is evaluating final legal technicalities and the tax advantages of constructing the plant before making its final proposal. The privately owned and built plant will provide steam for campus heating and cooling as well as generate profit for Cal Poly and the state from the sale of electricity. “It is now to the point that within the next three months we will know if it’s a go or no-go situation,\" Gerard said. While the profits from the sale of an estimated 28 megawatts of electricity each year is still an attractive incentive to Allied Signal Corporation, changes in the tax laws proposed by the Reagan Administration may drastically lower returns from the $30 million plant. Co-generation was first developed in the late 1800s and uses waste heat from the production of steam to turn a turbine and produce electricity. With the availability of cheap energy beginning in the 1950s, co-generation fell out of favor. By 1977, only four percent of energy for industry was cogenerated compared with nearly 50 percent at the turn of the century. High energy prices in the last two decades have prompted large energy users such as universities, hospitals and factories to reinvestigate co-generation as a cost-saving strategy. A well-designed system, Gerard said, will produ« more than 1.60 times more usable energy from See PLANT, hack page each unit of gas than a conventional system. Sevend companies have made proposals for the plant in the last three years, but the recent recession and the volatik natural gas and oil price situation have in-crestsed the ' risk of building alternative energy facilities that require large capital outlays. The state decided not to flnance the plant itself, Gerard said, because it would tie up too much of the sute’s resources. With a private firm, the state invests only land. The builder will own and operate the facility and sell steam to the university and power to PO R E. Part of the income from electricity sales and the profits from the lease of land to the bulkier will be split between the state and the university to be used for energy related projects. The advantage to the university is primarily an aconomk one. Ocirard said. An estimated $5 miUioo will be generated over the first five yesus of operation. The university, which uses approximately five megawatts of clectrkity each year, will continue to buy power directly from PO R E and will purchase steam fropi the new faidlity. Under the current proposal, steam from the natural gas fueled plant would be piped nearly two miles to the current steam plant across from the Health Center, The 4,000 pounds of steam produced each hour would then enter the 36,000 feet of underground pipe that heat and cool the major buildings on cam-pus._ The distance from the plant to the campus core required a. redesigning of the delivery pipe to increase the efficiency of the system. \"There are some losses associated with the distance.\" Gerard said, \"but it is not a signifkant item.\" The present steam plam. whkh is showing signs of old age, has nof been maintained in top condition in antidpation of the new facility being built. Chief engineer for Cal Poly, Robert Pahlow,, said that rust is starting to detwriorata some pumps and tanks ahhough “then is probably a lot of good yean kfl in the boilers.\" If a CO gensratioa facility is' buflt, the machinery and welding programs would be rdooated in the old steam plant.",
