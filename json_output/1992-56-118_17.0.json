    "article_text": "More fuel was added to the fire of hostility between the No. 2-seeded Cal Poly men’s tennis team and the No. 4-seeded UC Davis team. The Aggies put an abrupt stop to the Mustangs’ drive towards a NCAA National Championship Saturday when they soundly defeated the Mustangs, 5-2. Matches between the two teams are always huge because year after year the teams butt heads in the nationals. Saturday’s match was the rubber match of this season. The Aggies beat the Mustangs, 5-4, the first matchup. The Mustangs more than made up for the first loss by thrashing the Aggies, 8-1, in the Mustang Invitational. However, the Aggies had the last word in this year’s battle, which propelled them into the championship match against No. 3-seeded Hampton from Virginia. “Davis played a good match,” Poly Head Coach Chris Eppright said in a tone that clearly stated his disappointment. “Both teams were fired up and ready to play. (Davis) really took it to us. That’s by far the best match (Davis) played all year. “It’s tough*. Everyone is obviously disappointed because we were hoping to win. We got up in a few instances, but we let them back into it.” The match at the third seed was the example Eppright offered to prove his last statement. Marc Ollivier won the first set, 6-1, but then Davis’ Mark Lamonica came on strong and won in three sets. “The other matches weren’t close at all,” Eppright said. “We got killed.” The two Mustang victories came from No. 2-seeded Mark Nielson and No. 5-seeded Jeff Ar-nott. Nielson defeated Dave Allen, 6-3, 6-1. “The only surprise was at No. 2 where we had lost both times before, but we won this time easily,” Eppright said. Amott beat Jeff McCann, 6-1, 6-2. The Mustangs’ No. 3-seeded doubles. Josh Johnston and Jeff Amott, lost to Mark Ebner and Lamonica, 6-3, 6-3. The loss sealed the victory for the Aggies. UC Davis advanced by defeating No. 8-seeded Southwest Baptist from Missouri in the first round. On Sunday, the Mustangs rebounded by demolishing Rollins, 5-1. “It’s tough playing for third or fourth,” Eppright said. “They had such a go(^ year.” The Mustangs captured five of the six singles matches against Rollins, who beat Poly last year in the national championships. Poly’s No. 1-seed Max Allman led the charge with a convincing 6-4, 6-2 win over Darren Price, Rollin’s top-seeded player. Ollivier, Ricardo Reyes, Steve Amott and Josh Johnston also recorded victories for Poly. The Mustangs advanced to play against UC Davis by defeating No. 6-seeded Airostrong State from Savannah, Ga. The only losses suffered against Armstrong State were at the top two seeds.",
