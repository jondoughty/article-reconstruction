    "article_text": "The Cal Poly women’s tennis team has a problem that most other teams wish they had. With only two seniors and one junior, Head Coach Miguel Phelps is faced with the problem of having a very young team. “We are a very young team but we are very mature in the sense of having experience,” Phelps said. Last year’s team set a Cal Poly record for winning 21 matches in a row en route to a second place finish at the NCAA Division II Championships. Phelps lost two seniors to graduation and added four freshman to round out this year’s team. Phelps has had to change his strategy in response to the makeup of this year’s squad.“Since the team is young and all the players are talented, many of them will play a lot,” Phelps said. This year the team will play tougher opponents in the preseason to prepare them for the CCAA Conference matches. The team will take on seven Division I schools. With the exception of Fresno State, the women will have to play these schools on the road. With the tougher schedule, Phelps doesn’t expect the team to dominate the opposition as they did last year. “Though our record may not show our strength, our confidence and experience throughout the season should lead us to success in the nationals,” Phelps said. One player who leads the team with her experience and talent is sophomore Vicki Kanter. Last season Kanter was the lOth ranked singles player in the nation. When asked what she hoped to achieve this season, Kanter replied, “I want the team to win the National Championships.” “After losing five games to four last year, I know our team can win it this year,” Kanter said. When asked what team will be the toughest to play this year, Kanter replied, “UC Davis is the team to beat.” Another member of Phelps’ youth brigade is freshman Allison Lean. Phelps said. Lean was among the top ten junior players in Northern California last year. When asked what the goal of this years team was. Lean agreed with Kanter by saying, “winning nationals is our goal.” Phelps says the team will definitely get better as the year goes on. “With our season lasting four months long the important thing to remember is not to burn out too early in the year,” he said. To avoid burning out, Phelps structures the season so the players will be at their peak during the final part of the season.",
