With New York as the base of 100, Tokyo scored 171 and Osaka 157, the survey said. Libreville in the West African state of Gabon and Brazzaville in the Congo followed, at 134 and 133 respectively. California living was cheaper than the New York base, with a 95 score for Los Angeles and 94 for San FVancisco. In the list of 97 cities, Los Angeles was 54th and San Francisco 57th in living expenses for expatriates. Mexico City was 78th, with a score of 80 compared to New York. The cost of living in West Europe continued to be higher than in the United States, while most Latin American cities were still relatively cheap, the report said. Th2 Indian city of Bombay, at 61, was best value for expatriates of the 97 cities surveyed. The survey is published twice a year by the Geneva-based consultant Corporate Resources Group. It is based on a basket (T 151 products including food, clothing, recreation and transportation but not accommodation. The survey is intended to help international companies and governments determine cost of living differentials paid to employees living abroad. The survey was calculated using mid-September exchange rates and prices. The Iranian capital Tehran, which had been the most expen- sive city for several years, tumbled to 93 with an index of 65, compared to New York. The consultant group said it used the official internal rate of about 1,400 rials for one dollar, compared to 67 rials in last May’s survey. The Norwegian capital Oslo and the Swedish capital St(x;kh-olm tied for fifth place with a rating of 132 each. Finland’s Helsinki had an index of 129. The Swiss financial center Zurich rated 120 and Copenhagen and Geneva followed at 119. The survey showed that Asia is becoming more expensive for foreign employees. Taiwan’s capi- tal of Taipei had an index of 122, Beijing 113, Seoul 107 and Hong Kong 105. However, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Auckland, Manila and Karachi are all cheaper than New York. In Latin America, only the Peruvian capital Lima and Argentina’s Buenos Aires are more expensive than New York, with respective indexes of 107 and 104. This is because both countries have high inflation but have not devalued their currencies accordingly, CRG spokesman Carlos Mestre said. Toronto is the most expensive city in North America, with an index of 102.",
