    "article_text": "After a nationwide search. Cal Poly has hired a director for its ethnic studies program. Bob Gish, an English professor from the University of Northern Iowa, was selected from three finalists and has accepted an offer to fill the new position on campus. “He is really philosophically committed to this program. He was my personal choice of the three candidates interviewed. He is an excellent teacher and a University Distinguished Scholar in Iowa,” said Sidney Ribeau, dean of the School of Liberal Arts. In a telephone interview from Cedar Falls, Iowa, Gish said he has written three analytic-style history books, one literary biography, one volume of short fiction and “literally hundreds” of articles for publications such as the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune. His specialty fields are American, ethnic and American Indian literature. Gish is a Cherokee/Choctaw Native American who grew up in New Mexico. He said he accepted the position partially because he had “been homesick for the West for a long time,” and because he likes San Luis Obispo. Gish said he is looking forward to implementing the new program. “TTie university needs to move ahead on an ethnic studies program,” he said. “They made me an offer I couldn’t refuse,” he said of his tenured, full-professor position. Ribeau said Cal Poly wanted to hire Gish full-time when he was here last winter and spring quarters as a visiting scholar. “He was on leave, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to leave his job in Iowa to come here and start something totally new,” he said. Gish said about resigning from Iowa after 25 years of teaching, “I had mixed feelings about it. It’s one of those bittersweet things, but I’m up to the challenge.” Gish accepted the offer at the beginning of October and will start his new position in January. Willi Coleman, director of the Center for Women and Ethnic Issues, served on the interviewing committee along with two students and four professors. “I was impressed with the fact that he (Gish) exhibited interest in ethnicity,” Coleman said. “I would like to see the university commit itself. “We behave as though ethnicity is something foreign to us.” Coleman said most universities require an ethnic studies course as part of their general education requirements. Cal Poly is the only California State University school that does not offer a minor, major or concentration in ethnic studies, Ribeau said. The resolution passed by the Academic Senate endorses an improved ethnic studies program. It will be a long while, however, before courses become required due to the laborious curriculum-change process, Ribeau said. Gish’s duties as director will include identifying funding for new ethnic studies programs and locating money for seed (privately funded) grants, providing support for faculty in developing new courses in the area, developing a cultural diversity lecture series, acting as a liaison with other campuses and perhaps setting up a visiting scholar program. “What I want to do is reconcile differences,” Gish said. “I’m ready to move forward on an ethnic studies program.” Ribeau said the number of classes offered (currently two: Sec DIRECTOR, page 7 racism in American culture and cultural heritage) will not increase drastically with the creation of this new position. He hopes Gish will be able to identify new funding sources so that professors will have the time and resources available to develop new courses. “There is a significant number of professors interested in teaching and research in this area,” he said. Those teachers aren’t just in the School of Liberal Arts. Ribeau said engineering, agriculture and business professors have expressed interest as well. The fact that Gish is from out of state does not worry Ribeau. California has a different school system, and Gish will have to learn it quickly. Although he said this could be a disadvantage, Ribeau wasn’t overly worried about Gish adjusting to the change. On the positive side, having someone come in from outside the system could also be an advantage, Ribeau said. “He hasn’t been jaded and beaten down by bureaucracy and paperwork,” he said. “He has an optimistic view.” His first quarter here, Gish will focus on his administrative duties. After settling in, Gish will teach in the English department beginning with a modern novel course this spring.",
