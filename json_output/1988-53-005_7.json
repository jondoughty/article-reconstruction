    "article_text": "When 1 first started at Cal Poly, in fall 1986, I was immediately struck by how few minority students attend this school. As I walked around the campus my first few days here, 1 kept looking for Hispanic, Black and Asian students but what I mostly saw was white students. I had a hard time adjusting to this since I came from a university that was much more racially diverse than Cal Poly. I attended the University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kan., where students from Mexico, South America, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the United States learned and lived together. Mexicans, Nicaraguans, Africans, Chinese, Koreans and students from many other countries and from here learned about each other by studying, partying and living together. 1 learned quite a bit about myself and about other races when I lived with a black student from Kansas City, Kan. and later, with a student from Cuba. I did not realize when I applied to Cal Poly that it was for the most part an all-white university. But I soon realized it after my first week here. Granted, there are minority students attending school here, but they are few in number. When I last worked for the Mustang Daily, as the minority affairs reporter, there were about 72 white students for every black student. 1 doubt that number has changed very much since then. By attending school here, students are being deprived of real education: how to get along with, learn about and understand students who come from a different racial background and culture than themselves. When white students graduate from Cal Poly they are in for a rude awakening if they think the outside world is just like life on campus. White students will have to learn on their own how to get along with clients, customers, coworkers, and bosses who are minorities. Has Cal Poly failed in teaching its white students about other cultures and races by having so few minority students attend this school? I think so. By lacking in the cultural diversity found at",
