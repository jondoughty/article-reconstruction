    "article_text": "Editor — Who is Dan Quayle? The uproar over his use of family influence to avoid military service in Vietnam is obscuring other defects in his background. Quayle's close friends and family acknowledge his glaring lack of intellectual ability. Theodore Bendall, Quayles’s family attorney, recently said if he could change the Indiana senator he would “increase his I.Q. He is not an intellect.” Quayle’s father freely admits that his son’s main interest in school was “broads and booze.” Dan Quayle’s mediocre academic standing in high school apparently prevented him from applying to major universities. Instead he went to little DePauw University where his grandfather was a member of the board of trustees and a major contributor. In college Quayle had a reputation for being a poor student, frequently drinking to excess, and dating many women. A former professor says Quayle received mostly C’s and he got a D in at least one course in his major, political science. His good looks and nonintellectual image led some classmates to nickname him derisively as “face man.” Clark Adams, a former classmate, said “He was not a guy to take a position on anything except who his date was on Friday night and where to get drunk on Saturday night.” Another classmate, Joseph Wirt, said Quayle majored in “girls, golf, and alcohol” at DePauw. Quayle’s college record was so spotty that a furor erupted in 1982 when the college announced it would award an honorary doctor of laws degree to Quayle. The faculty secretly voted 32-24 against awarding the degree. Despite Quayle’s assertion that he joined the National Guard to go to law school as soon as possible, he did not go to law school right away. He did not meet Indiana University law school’s academic requirements. “They wouldn’t take him in,” his father, James Quayle, told the Washington Post. A year later, “somehow he got in, he talked his way in” and attended night school, James Quayle said. Quayle said he wanted to bypass the military because of his interest in law, but there is no evidence that he accomplished anything as an attorney. Quayle’s friends in the legal profession cannot remember any cases that he handled. Almost immediately after opening his law practice, Quayle told his father he wanted to do something else and became assistant publisher of his father’s newspaper. His grandfather, Eugene Pulliam, who headed the most powerful newspaper empire in Indiana, was famous for blatantly mixing right wing politics and newspaper journalism with impunity. Quayle’s father was a member of the John Birch Society in the 1960s. The financial and editorial backing of his father got Quayle elected to the House in 1976. With the strong backing of his uncle’s Indianapolis newspapers he became a U.S. senator in 1980. Voters have an opportunity to beat Bush and bag Quayle in November. Dan Quayle is another example of the intellectually bankrupt yuppie scum the country club Republicans are trying to foist on the American public as a poor excuse for leadership. The voters can see through their goody-two-shoes facade and trite cliches.",
