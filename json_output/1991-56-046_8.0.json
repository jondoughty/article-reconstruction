    "article_text": "MIAMI (AP) — Pan Am passengers scrambled to re-book flights during the heaviest travel time of the season and 7,500 employees found themselves out of work three weeks before Christmas when the once-glorious airline went under. The airline, which pioneered commercial aviation, abruptly shut down Wednesday after losing its battle to erase years of losses. Chanda Sharan of Jonesboro, Ga., sat in a baggage area at Miami International Airport with her two young daughters on their interrupted flight from Atlanta to Mexico City. But she seemed more concerned about Pan Am workers than her own predicament. “I feel bad. 1 really feel bad,” she said. “I’m originally from India, and we always flew Pan Am. It’s been in this country for so long. It’s like history.” The shutdown stranded thousands of passengers around the country, including 100 people removed from a flight to the Dominican Republic just before takeoff from New York’s Kennedy Airport. Several airlines said they would honor Pan Am tickets. But finding comparable flights during the busy holiday season is going to be difficult for many, said John Lindsey, a Pan A.m vice president. “Obviously,” he said, “it’s going to be tight.” “We’re all in shock,” he added. “It’s very, very tough for a 64-year-old airline and all the people who have gone through this.” M.any employees left jobless were transferring to Miami from other cities as part of an plan to transfoiTn the cairier into a smaller airline ftK’using on Latin America. That plan fell apart on Tuesday. Pilot Terry Barnes got the news when he radioed from the air for tlie gate numbers of connecting flights. He was told there wouldn’t be any connecting flights. Harry Tomisaka, a 23-year fleet service veteran from San Francisco, walked into work Wednesday — payday — and found he no longer had a job. “We came up to work and they just told us we couldn’t go in,” he said. Pan Am became the third U.S. airline to die this year, after Eastern and Midway, amid deep industrywide troubles brought on by the Gulf War and the recession. Pan Am bookings also were crippled by the 1988 terrorist bombing of Hight 103 over Scotland. The death blow came on Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court when Delhi Air Lines cut off financing to keep Pan Am in the air. Delta said it did not believe Pan Am’s business plan would work at a time when losses were about $2 million a day and b(K>k-ings were plunging. Luz Rodriguez of Puerto Rico, a retired Pan Am office worker, had taken a break from chemotherapy treatment for a trip to Orlando when the end came for Pan Am. “I said, Tm going to go for a ride before I die.’ And look what happened,” she said. She and her husband arrived at Miami Airport on one of the airline’s last flights. The couple continued their trip on American Airlines and got there less than three hours late. Pan Am was founded in 1927 and inaugurated the first scheduled international flight — a mail run between Key West, Fla., and Havana, Cuba — the first scheduled trans-Pacific service (1935), and the first scheduled trans-Atlantic service (1939).",
