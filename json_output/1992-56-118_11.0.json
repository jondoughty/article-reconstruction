    "article_text": "California State University crime statistics show Cal Poly as one of the safest campuses in the CSU system. Unfortunately, this may cause some students to think less about their safety than they should. “People need to think about it all the time,” said Joseph Risser, Director of ^bic Safety. “They need to think about safety first rather than the convenience of ‘Well, ni just cut through here,’ ” he said. Cal Poly had one violent crime reported in 1991. The highest number reported was 50, at CSU Northridge. As far as property is concerned, Cal Poly’s parking lots seem to be getting safer. Thefts from motor vehicles are down from 217 in 1990 to 125 in 1991. Only seven cars were reported stolen last year. Bikes thefts have decreased as well, with 61 reported stolen in 1991, compared to 93 in 1990. Risser said that thefts of bikes and cars go in cycles, and that the police pay special attention to parking lots when problems start appearing. Many of the car thefts are committed by outside groups, he said. All of these statistics are compiled from reported offenses. Risser said the department tries hard to encourage people to report any t)q)e of crime, but that the negative image of police held by some segments of the public can make that hard. Thefts from campus buildings were up from 91 in 1990 to 123 in 1991. Risser said that this may be because the campus key-security system is not a good one. He said there are a lot of people with keys who can leave doors open, or feel safe and don’t bother to lock them. Of crimes against people. Cal Poly was second-highest in reported sex offenses in 1991 with 18, one up from the previous year, and nine more than 1989. San Diego State reported 25. Risser said that he didn’t know if people were reporting them more, or if they were increasing in frequency. Cal Poly rates well, compared to national statistics from a USA Tbday survey, which show that in the West, there are 7.2 violent crimes per every 10,000 students. The survey also said that the safest campuses are those with between 10,000 and 20,000 students in a city under 100,000. Risser said that most students don’t have safety as a priority, because of the location of the school and the small number of incidents. “People get the impression that it’s safe here, so (they) don’t have to think about where (they’re) walking,” he said. “That’s not d good idea.”",
