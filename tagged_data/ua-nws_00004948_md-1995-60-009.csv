267,4,8,"TXT","4",0,0,"What is the point of Ben’s argument regarding people’s inequalities? Is he suggesting that if you are not naturally brilliant, it is the “minority’s” obligation to negate education and live a life based on athletic ability? And in the same paragraph he states, “If none of us had our own separate gifts and talents, we would not be able to tell each other apart.” How do you tell people apart in your everyday life? I use such criteria as personality and physical api>earance. This statement is too vague to effectively support his argument"
268,4,8,"TXT","5",0,0,"My second and last rebuttal concerns Ben Schein’s hard work to increase his SAT score. How many financially challenged families have the money to send their child to a workshop such as the Princeton Review? Not too many. Ben Schein ignores the realization that not everybody can participate in specialized workshops to improve their SAT scores. It is important to be sensitive and considerate when judging other people and the situation they are in. Oddly enough, there are students who want to succeed in their stupes,, but their surrounding environment prevents them from doing so. For example, what if you go to school in a poor community and getting good grades includes getting beat up after school each day because your classmates feel you are too studious. Education quickly develops a bitter taste."
269,4,8,"TXT","6",0,0,"I agree with Ben Schein’s view that people should be accepted an merit, not ethnicity, but it is important to be considerate of other people’s backgrounds. Unfortunately some students abuse the system, but we must not label every minority student as a lazy parasite. In closing, it is my advice to Ben Schein to, for starters, calm down and then rethink his arguments. In the words of my English teacher, if you are willing to give your opinion, you should also be willing to accept honest criticism."
