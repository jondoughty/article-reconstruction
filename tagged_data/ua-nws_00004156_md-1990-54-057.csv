91,2,4,"TXT","6",0,0,"Coffman constructed a three-stage scaffolding upon which I can hang his argument. Two criticisms don’t address aspects of King’s public life and moral philosophy, which ideally should be the only debatable subjects. They instead resort to speculations about King’s personal life and to guilt by association by giving his aides the hackneyed communist label. A third argument contains quotes so badly misconstrued they reveal Coffman’s malicious intent."

It is not illegal nor necessarily un-American to associate with individuals who have communist ties; nevertheless, King was always anticommunist.

95,2,4,"TXT","9",0,0,"As to Coffman’s erroneous perception of King’s moral philosophy, his blatant misuse of quotes from “I Have a Dream” is despicable. The “whirlwinds of revolt” statement and all others King made of that nature show when he mentioned violence, he was only stating the fact of its already present existence — for example, in Watts or Detroit. King never condoned rioting or violence of any form. His notion of power was bound up inextricably in a doctrine of love and intrinsic unity of the human race."

127,2,5,"TXT","10",0,0,"This experience has been shared by many blacks across the nation when they were young, including myself. Imagine the feeling that as a people your culture had accomplished nothing. Many Americans know nothing of the accomplishments of Louis Lattimer, Dr. Charles R.

128,2,5,"TXT","11",0,0,"Growing up without a sense of pride in who you are is difficult. Being denied access to the heritage of the black man, many blacks grow up thinking they are little more than what they saw on television just 10 years ago — television where blacks were portrayed as pimps, street whores and hustlers, killers and criminals. People — especially young, impressionable black and white youths — believe what is seen on television."
129,2,5,"TXT","12",0,0,"Ignorance of peoples’ cultures is one problem of all Americans, We as a country are so ethnocentric we have created a Berlin Wall of sorts by not allowing others’ ideas to penetrate our little world. This “Berlin W'all” is even more opposing than the actual one in Germany was, for this wall is of the mind. Physical barriers are easy to overcome; mental barriers take much more of an earnest effort to rise above."

In order for people to respect us, and indeed to respect ourselves, we must know who we are and where we come from. One month out of a year isn’t going to erase 371 years of denial, but it must start somewhere. And to my brothers and sisters.
