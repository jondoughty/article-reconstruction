10,1,1,"TXT",3,0,0,"Larry Rodkey, owner of the only operating drive-in in San Luis Obispo County, the Sunset Drive-In, said drive-in disappearance is caused by many factors."
11,1,1,"TXT",4,0,0,"“The land that drive-ins take up is the major reason you won’t see any more drive-ins going up,’’ Rodkey said. “The owners of the land find it much more profitable to put in shopping centers. Also, people prefer to go to walk-in theaters"

14,1,1,"TXT",6,0,0,"“Because of expanding land values, it’s just not feasible for the owners of the land to use it for a drive-in any more,” Gunn said."
15,1,1,"TXT",7,0,0,"Another problem drive-ins face is getting first-run, top-quality Hollywood movies from the major distributors, which usually go to the big movie chains such as Mann theaters."

18,1,1,"TXT",9,0,0,"Rodkey said the reason theaters such as Mission Cinemas, Fremont Theatre, Festival Cinemas and Madonna Plaza charge the usual $5 for a movie, while other theaters such as Fair Oaks and the Bay Theatre can show movies for less, is because the big theaters have to pay a high price to get a first-run movie, while smaller theaters have to wait until it’s played everywhere else before they can show it."
19,1,1,"TXT",10,0,0,"“The first-run theaters have to charge the $5 just to pay for the movie they get,” Rodkey said. “The smaller theaters like the Fair Oaks and the Bay Theatre have to pay a percentage of what they make on the movie after it’s played everywhere else.

43,1,2,"TXT",10,0,0,"Higgins said that in the future corporate sponsorship will be a great way to bring top-notch speakers and entertainment to Cal Poly. “It can cost us up to $20,000 to put on some shows,” he said. “This way we minimize our risk, make some money and get good quality programs.”"

231,4,11,"TXT",1,0,0,"Most students will never meet Cal Poly President Warren Baker because his time on campus is cut in half by his off-campus traveling."
232,4,11,"TXT",2,0,0,"Baker spends an average of 50 percent of his time off campus, according to his secretary, Grace Arvidson. This makes it necessary to divide his time on campus very carefully between the administration, faculty, students and community."
233,4,11,"TXT",3,0,0,"“He is very involved and would like to be more involved with a lot of other (student) groups than he can,” Arvidson said. “But he is always accessible for the things he needs to be involved with.”"
234,4,11,"TXT",4,0,0,"Frequently students will approach Arvidson with personal academic problems, asking to see Baker before using other proper channels and Arvidson will have to redirect them. “1 will refer them to someone in the academic area: their adviser, a department head, school dean, or even the vice president of Academic Affairs.”"
235,4,11,"TXT",5,0,0,"Because of his many responsibilities, Baker does not have time to meet with every student and hear their personal problems, although he will make time for students who have absolutely exhausted other channels."
236,4,11,"TXT",6,0,0,"“1 will help students who can’t be helped by anyone else and 1 always look for informal opportunities to meet with students. That’s when I learn the most,” Baker said. “What 1 do is try to accept as many invitations to student events as 1 can. I will also meet with any faculty member who wants to see me.”"
237,4,11,"TXT",7,0,0,"“He does have an open-door policy,” Arvidson said. “If a student comes in to see him and he isn’t busy, he will invite them in.” A few years ago Baker tried maintaining a weekly walk-in hour, “but it really didn’t work out, because students and faculty with problems came in trying to get the president to solve them. But he’s not involved with the day-to-day operations and doesn’t have time to solve problems that can be helped elsewhere.”"
238,4,11,"TXT",8,0,0,"Arvidson and Baker go over his calendar regularly to prioritize it, determining who he"
239,4,11,"TXT",8,0,0,"can see and what events he can attend."
240,4,11,"TXT",9,0,0,"“He likes to meet with students. He enjoys them and has good rapport with them. He especially likes to meet with groups when they invite him.” Baker receives many invitations from groups and tries to alternate those he accepts each year so that he can meet with as many different groups as possible. He also meets with ASI, the Poly Royal Board and the Academic Senate on a regular basis, but even those meetings are subject to his busy traveling schedule."
241,4,11,"TXT",10,0,0,"Baker travels every month to meetings with the California State University Board of Trustees, the CSU Presidents’ Executive Council, and the National Science Council, to which he was appointed by President Reagan. Before his appointment to the NSC, he held an appointed position on the Board for International Food and Agriculture Development. By policy, he can only maintain one presidential appointment at a time."

275,5,12,"TXT",1,0,0,"For the better part of the past three months the men’s track team has done all it can to qualify competitors for the national championships. And now, the day before the championships begin at Cape Girardeau, Mo., 11 athletes have qualified."
276,5,12,"TXT",2,0,0,"The first to qualify in 1987 was freshman Steve Toney, who pole vaulted 16-1 in the first meet of the season at San Diego State. And, somewhat appropriately, it was pole vaulter Hans Florine who was the final qualifier at what is termed the Last Chance Meet at Cal State Los Angeles this past Sunday."
277,5,12,"TXT",3,0,0,"Florine’s qualification is appropriate in that it brings the number of pole vaulters who will compete in Cape Girardeau to four, which is not surprising considering the Mustangs have been deep in pole vaulting all season."
278,5,12,"TXT",4,0,0,"While Cal Poly has qualified 11 athletes, two — Dave Johnson and Brent Griffiths — have broken the NCAA Division 11 standards in two events."
279,5,12,"TXT",5,0,0,"Although they have each qualified for two races, Johnson and Griffiths will more than likely compete in only one, due to the number of races that must be held in each event."
280,5,12,"TXT",6,0,0,"Johnson, a senior hurdler, has qualified in both the highs and intermediates, although he is ex-"
281,5,12,"TXT",6,0,0,"pected to run only the intermediates."
282,5,12,"TXT",7,0,0,"Cal Poly coach Tom Henderson said the only way Johnson will run the high hurdle race is if he doesn’t have to go through preliminary heats before reaching the championships on Saturday."
283,5,12,"TXT",8,0,0,"“Our initial intent was not to run him (Johnson) in the highs,’’ said Henderson. “The whole emphasis this year has been on the intermediates with the intention of having him win it.’’"
284,5,12,"TXT",9,0,0,"As it stands, 10 runners nationwide have qualified for the 110-meter hurdle race, which makes it possible that preliminary heats will still have to be run."
285,5,12,"TXT",10,0,0,"Going into the meet, Johnson has the second fastest time nationwide in the intermediates and the eighth fastest in the highs. At the conference championships a week ago Johnson won both events."
286,5,12,"TXT",11,0,0,"Griffiths, meanwhile, has qualified in both the 1,500 and"
287,5,12,"TXT",11,0,0,"5,000-meter races, but will more than likely run only the longer of the two."
288,5,12,"TXT",12,0,0,"He has the second-fastest time in Division 11 at 5,000 meters and if he ran in both events, the two final races would be only one hour and 50 minutes apart."
289,5,12,"TXT",13,0,0,"Among the pole vaulters who qualified — Toney, Florine, Kevin Rankin and Steve Horvath — Horvath is the top ranked of the four."

298,5,12,"TXT",15,0,,"Rankin, meanwhile, qualified for nationals early in the season and has spent the past several weeks recovering from a hip injury he suffered at the West Coast Relays in Fresno the first week of April."
299,5,12,"TXT",16,0,,"“He’s fine and he’s been jumping very well,” said Henderson. “At the conference meet the pressure was on and everything that could have gone wrong did.”"
