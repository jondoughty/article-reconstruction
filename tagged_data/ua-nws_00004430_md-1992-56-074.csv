233,4,13,"BL","0",0,0,"By John Hubbell"
234,4,13,"TXT","1",0,0,"Let’s have some fun today by talking about car alarms and, specifically, how exactly we should torture those who own them."
235,4,13,"TXT","2",0,0,"Quid pro quo, dear readers. For years on end, car alarm owners have been waking us up morning, noon and night, selfishly stealing the serenity of a good b<K)k, compact disc or simple peace and quiet. Whenever the world seems too much, the car alarm’s whining mating call is the final straw that sends us teetering onto the edge of insanity."
236,4,13,"TXT","3",0,0,"“Wee-uh wee-uh wee-uh,” it says."
237,4,13,"TXT","4",0,0,"we say back."
238,4,13,"TXT","5",0,0,"Finally, after years of complacency and suffering, the Andy Rooney side of me is fed up. It’s time to take action."
239,4,13,"TXT","6",0,0,"First, a brief history, as this invasion of car alarms is not a new phenomenon."
240,4,13,"TXT","7",0,0,"My earliest memories of them go back to a “TJ. Hooker” episode in which Romano (Adrian Zmed) bought a snazzy sports car equipped with all the latest gadgets. He was then able to gain the adoration of several Heather Locklear stunt doubles by standing 20 feet away from the car outside a nightclub and, with one beep-beep of his key ring gizmo, putting a near-kryp-tonite shield around it. Sneezing five blocks away set off something similar to the Diablo Canyon sirens, which kept Romano’s car plenty safe while he was inside catching Dance Fever and, presumably, a host of"
241,4,13,"TXT","7",0,0,"other diseases."
242,4,13,"TXT","8",0,0,"That was 1983, and since, car alarms — as well as Adrian Zmed — have both outlived their usefulness. Instead of alerting us to a possible theft in progress, car alarms most often do nothing more than hurt our ears. What do we say when we hear rorne-one’s alarm going off.^ “Uh-oh! I’d better rush to the police and report this!” Perhaps."
243,4,13,"TXT","9",0,0,"Nope. “There goes someone’s stupid car alarm again,” THAT’S what we say."
244,4,13,"TXT","10",0,0,"So how do we rid the planet of these things? Fear not. While it is improbable lawmakers will soon ban these devices, there are a few handy things you, the reader, can do to indirectly shut these things up."
245,4,13,"TXT","11",0,0,"In a word: PAM."
246,4,13,"TXT","12",0,0,"“Pam,” suggested an acquaintance on Tuesday, referring to that fun all-purpose kitchen spray. “Put it on their windshield. It’ll come off with some soap and water.”"
247,4,13,"TXT","13",0,0,"I’m starting to feel better already, ni even do my part now by providing a paragraph you can stick into the windshield wiper:"

250,4,13,"TXT","15",0,0,"car alarm has ceased to disrupt the natural beauty of the Central Coast."
251,4,13,"TXT","16",0,0,"Undoubtedly, a few of you will give this a quick read and take to putting SPAM on windshields of yelping cars. This is also acceptable. Both are certainly a shade less harmful than the ’ol tator-in-the-tailplpe trick. It may sound cruel now, but let’s see how you feel the next time someone’s alarm trips off at 3 a.m."
252,4,13,"TXT","17",0,0,"There are more diplomatic means to pursue, I guess. How about a separate lot for alarm-equipped cars on campus located further into the hills behind the sheep unit? Or maybe little plastic window triangles that say"
253,4,13,"TXT","17",0,0,"“Car alarm on board” so we’ll know which cars to spray. Car alarms and plastic window triangles may be a dangerous combination, though. What if they were to breed?"
254,4,13,"TXT","18",0,0,"In reality, I suggest some ground rules be put into play:"
255,4,13,"TXT","19",0,0,"—	Car alarm owners should use their systems sparingly, making sure to turn them off on windy or rainy nights. Unlike in Los Angeles, the rights of human beings still supersede those of cars here."
256,4,13,"TXT","20",0,0,"—	If you have an ugly car, don’t buy a car alarm. If you have an American car, see above."
257,4,13,"TXT","21",0,0,"—	If you’ve had your car longer than five years, get rid of"
258,4,13,"TXT","22",0,0,"your alarm. Rare are the stories which begin: “Police today caught a ring of thieves who preyed exclusively on 1984 Ford Fairmonts and Pintos.” Think of your well-traveled car as an aged pet. When it’s time to let go, it’s time to let go."
259,4,13,"TXT","23",0,0,"So there you have it. It’s time to enter the battle against these little buggers, which will go on to elect their own president and declare war on US if not soon stopped. The fight is ours to be won, and sleep is ours to be had."

304,4,14,"TXT","2",0,0,"My presentation focused principally on the misconceptions most members of the university community have concerning affirmative action and the suggestion that one way to remedy this situation is to embrace the many benefits which ethnic studies offers to everyone, not just members of minority groups. By its very definition, ethnic studies provides validation and recognition of the many contributions made by all ethnic groups which make up the United States, rather than just those of the dominant minority."

I have been misquoted by the Daily before and recognize that this does happen. However, if Ted’s statements were in response to Parenti’s argument cited here, they are totally irrelevant.
