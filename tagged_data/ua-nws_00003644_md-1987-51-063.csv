Only after Kenvin put the Shakespeare book away did Tillie show that she could jump on the table. Not to be outdone, Millie followed suit."

224,4,10,"TXT","1",0,0,"In the California Collegiate Athletic Association, emerging winless from a two-game home-stand is a no-no. After doing just that this past weekend, the Cal Poly basketball team finds itself in a position where the postseason tournament and playoffs may be a no-no."
225,4,10,"TXT","2",0,0,"The losses — 75-56 to UC Riverside on Friday and 60-57 to Cal Poly Pomona on Saturday — dropped the Mustangs’ CCAA record to 2-3. Even more telling of the situation is that Poly has fallen into the bottom half of the standings. Only the top four teams are invited to the CCAA’s postseason tournament."
226,4,10,"TXT","3",0,0,"“It hurts,’’ said Poly coach Steve Season. “In this conference, you have to win at home. We’ve really got to look for those wins next week."
227,4,10,"TXT","4",0,0,"“I think I’ve made a realistic goal of making the top four but it’s going to be tough because there isn’t a weak team in this conference.’’"
228,4,10,"TXT","5",0,0,"Poly found out Friday that when the Dynamic Duo is shut down, a not-so-dynamic ending is the result. For the first time this season, Sean Chambers and Melvin Parker both were held to single-figure scoring. Chambers was two of 12 from the floor and finished with seven points."
229,4,10,"TXT","5",0,0,"Parker was five for 14 and scored"
230,4,10,"TXT","5",0,0,"10."
231,4,10,"TXT","6",0,0,"The cold shooting was contagious. Poly connected on only 39 percent of its shots. Despite the inability to find the hoop, the Mustangs managed to take the lead once in the first half and close to within two twice in the second half."
232,4,10,"TXT","7",0,0,"“I think the problem was for the first time this season, we faced two dominant big people,’’ said Mark Shelby, who led the Mustangs with 11 points."
233,4,10,"TXT","8",0,0,"Riverside’s twin towers of Robert Jimerson, who finished with a game-high 24 points, and Paul Kapturkiewicz kept the Mustangs out of the key most of the contest. Kapturkiewicz, a 6-9 center, blocked a pair of shots early, and that kept Poly aware of his presence the rest of the way."
234,4,10,"TXT","9",0,0,"Riverside led, 32-24, at halftime. Parker and Jeff Gray led the way after intermission, as Poly cut the deficit to two. The Mustangs could not maintain the attack, however, as Riverside had its cushion back to eight points in little time. But instead of going off to the races, it was off to the free throw line."
