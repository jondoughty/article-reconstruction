I feel many people who flippantly use this term have never read the constitution because no such rights exist. It is a myth. If a child is being molested in the apartment next door to mine and I do nothing about it because I respect the right to privacy of the child molester, then I would be considered by most to be partially guilty of the crime. It would be ludicrous to not at least call the police. What claim then, do abortion rights activists have on such a right if child molesters do not?"

The “Constitutional right” that protects a mother’s choice to kill her unborn child should not be equated with the freedom of speech or freedom of religion. The decision Roe v. Wade is a highly controversial one and has not stood the test of time that the freedoms guaranteed in the Bill of Rights have."

A member of the IRA board was removed mysteriously prior to initialization of the referendum committee apparently on account of his viewpoint against the referendum.
