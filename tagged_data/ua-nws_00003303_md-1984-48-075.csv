The remaining bills ware authored by ASI officers, who cannot even vote on them “ You are correct in stating that a small percentage of senators have introduced bills.

  The bands that are still available for possible concerts before June include John Cougar, Elvis Costello, Roy Orbison, .38 Special and U2, said Morales.

  No more concerts have been held in the gym since October when Railey put a halt to them. Railey’s concern came after the Motels and X concerts.

  These concerts didn’t cause specific problems, but according to Morales, it was the last straw for Railey in dealing with concerts over the years. “He got to a point where be had to stop and evaluate the situation, said Morales."
184,5,1,"TXT",10,0,0,"  “There were some concerns he had that we didn't know were causing problems,"" said Morales. The biggest issue was the use of the gym floor."
185,5,1,"TXT",11,0,0,"  In the past, the Concert Committee has tried to control the entry of people wearing hard-soled shoes on the floor, the amount of smoking and the abuse of the gym floor. “However with 3,000 people in there with a sold-out concert, it’s almost inevitable someone will light up a cigarette.” said Morales."
186,5,1,"TXT",12,0,0,"  Railey feels the facility was built as a physical education area and the use of the facility should be for those purposes. ""The gym was not built for concerts, it was built for participatory activities,"" he said."
187,5,1,"TXT",13,0,0,"  But the Concert Committee still needs a facility, said Morales. “We understand it is a f 11 pings to be able to use it, and we feel we can work together since we don’t have one to use,"" he said."
188,5,1,"TXT",14,0,0,"  One of Railey’s biggest complaints was a gouge in the wooden floor that was taken out when the stage platform was moved in for the Motels concert."
189,5,1,"TXT",15,0,0,"  “The gouge is thare forever, because wa can’t sand it out,"" said Rjuley."
190,5,1,"TXT",16,0,0,"  To protect the floor in the future, guidelines state a plastic floor covering will be laid across the floor from bleacher to bleacher for all sit down concerts."
191,5,1,"TXT",17,0,0,"  Shoe checks will also be more strictly enforced to prevent hard-soled shoos, and smoking, food and drink will be forbidden in the gym."
192,5,1,"TXT",18,0,0,"  Another problem is caused by the lobby doors being blocked during concerts, said Railey. Previously, the"

516,9,1,"TXT",20,0,0,"   Hailey said that the last few concerts have been held on Sunday and Monday nights when faculty would be using their offices. “It causes a special problem for coaches who work seven days a week during the season,” ha added."
517,9,1,"TXT",21,0,0,"   Guidelines now state that the media door will be moved to the main entrance so as not to obstruct entry to the lobby of the gym. A security officer will be stationed at the media door as well. ^"
518,9,1,"TXT",22,0,0,"   Railey said he is still concerned about the entire building being shut down for a concert being held in one area of the building. “Students by the droves come in to workout on the weekends and dosing the building obstructs their right to use the building,” he said. No solution for that problem is stated in the guidelines."
519,9,1,"TXT",23,0,0,"   Performers have also abused parts of the building, according to Railey. He said rooms used by the performers have smelled so strongly of marijuana that “instructors reported that they couldn't breathe."""
520,9,1,"TXT",24,0,0,"   As a result, the wrestling room will no longer be used as a snack bar and classrooms will no longer be used as dressing rooms for performers and concert workers. Instead, trailers or motor homes, when needed, will be moved to the back of the gym for dressing or rest areas for the performers, guidelines state."
521,9,1,"TXT",25,0,0,"   Other guidelines deal with crowd control procedures. Because of police concern, concert-goers will not be allowed to line up for concerts until four hours before the performance. That lineup used to be able to start at 6 a.m. the morning of the concert, but Railey believes that encourages people to bring coolers and motivates them to “get bombed out and throw up during the concert.”"

525,9,1,"TXT",29,0,0,"    Morales said the Concert Committee has investigated alternative sites to hold a concert, but none is as good as the gym."
526,9,1,"TXT",30,0,0,"    Chumash Auditorium has been cancelled out as a possible site for two reasons, said Morales. The auditorium is small, so the performers would have to stage two shows in order for the Concert Committee to break even. Morales also thinks there is not enough in-treet in small groups at a concert."
527,9,1,"TXT",31,0,0,"    The second reason, said Morales, is the weak floor. No dances can be held in the auditorium because of the floor, and many of the concerts encourage dancing."
528,9,1,"TXT",32,0,0,"    Morales said the committee has considered holding another concert in the University Union Plaza like it did last year with the Plimsoula and Kingbees. If permission is granted for an outdoor concert, Morales . thinks the concert could be controlled and planned in such a way that it would end early."
529,9,1,"TXT",33,0,0,"    Several nearby residents, including President Warren Baker, complained of the noise from the concert last year. ""I still hope in the future we can have another outdoor concert.” said Morales, “maybe in Poly Grove.”"
530,9,1,"TXT",34,0,0,"    The Concert Committee even checked alternative sites off campus such as the Cuesta College gym, but problems exist with that solution also, said Morales."

532,9,1,"TXT",36,0,0,"    “We missed out on holding a Madness concert on March 2 because of paper work,"" said Morales. According to him, the Concert Committee asked to use one of the gyms at Cuesta. Cuesta officials were hesitant because the gyms are rarely rented out for outside use, but they made an exception and granted it."
