To express one's opinion about such matters, as Altieri has done and as I am doing now. is healthy, but only when that which is presented as fact is indeed factual In the physical sciences it is true that discovery and progress is built on speculation; in matters of the social sciences, however, we are neither so burdened nor so blessed with absolutes and lo speculate, especially about things which are known but simply have not been revealed to us. is irresponsible."

265,5,8,"TXT",2,0,0,"Cranston, the Democratic senator from California, spoke with the panel before a group of more than 60 residents assembled in the Council Chambers. He called the present tax system “unfair,"" suggesting that it be replaced by a modified flat tax that would get rid of the “unfair loopholes” that exist in the present system."
266,5,8,"TXT",3,0,0,"“In 1983...150 Americans earned S50 million and paid no taxes,” Cranston_^ said. “Sixty-five U.S corporations earned $50 billion and paid no federal income taxes.”"
267,5,8,"TXT",4,0,0,"With a modified flat tax structure, the government would be able to collect more money in taxes without raising them. Individuals and companies presently not paying their fair share would be more easily tracked down by the Internal Revenue Service under a simpler system, Cranston said. Also, if 'Americans felt the tax system was more equitable, he said they would be less inclined to cheat on their tax forms."
268,5,8,"TXT",5,0,0,"Cranston said that although most deductions and loopholes would be eliminated, those in the interest of the general public — such as charitable giving' — would be left intact."
269,5,8,"TXT",6,0,0,"Panelist Suzanne Yost, local real estate agent, questioned the senator on the implications of a flat tax. She said if deductions on investment property were cut, there would be little incentive for more building. In cities where"

271,5,8,"TXT",7,0,0,"Cranston replied that the proposed reforms would leave people with more money at their disposal for buying and renting, and thus would actually stimulate the economy."
