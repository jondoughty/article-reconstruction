274,5,10,"TXT","2",0,0,"Public administration professors Alan Settle and Carl Lutrin co-authored a book, against the many warnings they received. Lutrin said, “A lot of publishers told us that writing a book together is worse than being married, but our partnership works because each of us holds up our end.” Dividing up the chapters equally, the two teachers felt that working as a team would make the project more interesting. Lutrin said, “There’s a lot of truth to the (notion oO loneliness and silence in writing — there’s only the typewriter.”"

276,5,10,"TXT","3",0,0,"Settle explained the reasons behind the writing of “American Public Administration and Concepts,” which is now in its third edition. “I could put the concepts I enjoy teaching in public administration and distribute them all over the country.”"

279,5,10,"TXT","5",0,0,"That’s long been an advantage of this textbook.”"
280,5,10,"TXT","6",0,0,"Often satisfaction is the only reward a textbook writer receives for the hundreds of hours of effort that go into the project. Although John Devore’s first writing effort is one of the best selling statistics books in the country, he estimates that the payoff comes to less than $30 an hour. He said, “You have to go into it thinking more than just money; most of the textbooks are written because teachers have pride in the subject, or perhaps for reasons of ego.”"
281,5,10,"TXT","7",0,0,"Whatever the motivating force, a great deal of effort goes into making a first-rate book. Devore estimates he put more than 3,(XX) hours into research, writing and rewriting. He explained that textbooks are written in pieces which are shuttled back and forth between the writer and editor in an effort to catch all errors and work out any disagreements over content. He said, “You don’t see things like this in a novel, but in a technical book most publishers like a year in the production stage.” He added that each stage is important, though not always interesting. “Take indexing: it’s a lousy, thankless task. But it’s still important.”"
282,5,10,"TXT","8",0,0,"Sometimes a separate publication service is used to compile the book."
283,5,10,"TXT","8",0,0,"Settle said that often these companies can make a difficult task even worse. He said,"

In the statistics department, the choice is made by a majority vote of all the teachers in that major. When it came time to decide on “Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences,” Devore did not vote.

290,5,10,"TXT","10",0,0,"He admitted that in 15 years at Cal Poly, he has never seen the teachers in his department reject a co-worker’s textbook. He said, “I think most faculty feel if they respect the person, that they’ll at least give the book a chance, if there are no major problems.” Francois explained why he chooses to use his own book: “I know my textbook better than any other textbook in the field, and I know how to present that information.”"
291,5,10,"TXT","12",0,0,"Lutrin added, “It’s not an ego thing ... I can’t tell if the book is good unless I use it in class. 1 could read the book 40 times (but) the only thing that matters is how the students respond to it.”"
292,5,10,"TXT","13",0,0,"Daniel Stubbs, head of the computer science department and co-author of two textbooks, pointed out a conflict of interest is not the only pitfall that may await textbook authors. He said, “When you teach out of your own textbook, you’re not being exposed to someone else’s ideas on the subject, unless you keep up with them on the outside. But when someone writes a textbook on a subject, then you can be pretty sure they know it.”"

304,5,10,"TXT","20",0,0,"He admitted that another reason for revision is to combat the evergrowing used textbook market in which national distribution companies have a profitable field.
