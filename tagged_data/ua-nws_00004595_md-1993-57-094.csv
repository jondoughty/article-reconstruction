,17,7,"TXT","1",0,,"Do you remember your first word?"
,17,7,"TXT","2",0,0,"Probably not, but maybe your mom wrote it into the appropriate slot in your baby book. Mine did. And my first recorded word is “n-n-no."" Some folks would say that fact explains a lot, but anyway..."
,17,7,"TXT","3",0,0,"Maybe your first word was “mommy,” or “daddy,” finally giving a name to a familiar person. As babies, we usually recognize an object or a person before we learn their names. And later, new words not only give names to things we know, but also give preconceived notions about unfamiliar phenomena before we experience them for ourselves. Words shape the perceptions of the world around us through both their obvious and implied meanings. We often turn to dictionaries to define those un-feumiliar terms."
,17,7,"TXT","4",0,0,"Aside from their purpose in defining language, dictionaries also carry some weight in shaping societal norms. Robert L. Chapman says in American Slang, “Dictionaries are popularly thought to have strong influence. They are thought to give validity and authority to their entries, and therefore to have social and moral impact.”"
,17,7,"TXT","5",0,0,"Some may argue that dictionaries merely reflect society’s ideas and feelings, but I say otherwise. By the ronnotations in their definitions, dictionaries mold people’s perceptions of ideas. Sometimes these connotations reflect outdated or unflattering feelings about a subject, and such is the case with words pertaining to women. In this way, many dictionaries are subtly sexist."
,17,7,"TXT","6",0,0,"I first encountered this situation when looking up the word “feminine.” Webster’s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary lists “like a woman, weak, gentle” among its definitions."
,17,7,"TXT","7",0,0,"My objection stems from the characterization of women as weak. Webster’s definition of “weak” includes “liable to yield, break or collapse under pressure or strain; fragile; frail” among other unflattering listings such as “not having much political strength, governing power or authority ... impotent, ineffectual, or inadequate ... deficient in mental power, intelligence, or judgment ... not having much moral strength or firmness,"

,17,7,"TXT","8",0,0,"I resent the implication that to be feminine, I have to be ineffective, stupid, immoral and frail. The idea of physical weakness as an element of femininity also clashes with the reality of many female athletes. Figure skating demands much physical strength to perform the jumps, twists and spins in the routines, yet it would be difficult to argue that female figure skaters are"
,17,7,"BQT","0",0,0,"I resent the implication that to be feminine, I have to be ineffective, stupid, immoral and frail."
,17,7,"TXT","8",0,0,"not feminine and graceful in the presentation of their athletic skills."
,17,7,"TXT","9",0,0,"The dictionary’s inclusion of “weak” as a definition of “feminine"" does not apply to modem society nor does the word “passive.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary. Unr abridged includes that term in its explanation of “feminine* and gives the example “masculine aggression and feminine tendencies.” I resent the implication that women are not supposed to act aggressively. In fact, those who do often receive the label “bitch” because they supposedly are not behaving appropriately. 1 think we need to redefine “feminine” to include the idea of professionally, intellectually, morally, emotionally, and physically strong women who act with grace and tact."
,17,7,"TXT","10",0,0,"Webster’s Third also defines “passive” as “not acting but acted upon; subject to or produced by an external agency; receptive to outside impressions or influences” and includes the example “a vague, passive girl, content to remain at home and dream.” I don’t like that definition OR that example. The definition leaves the impression that to be feminine, a woman must live an inactive life, affected only by the whims erf"" other individuals. She takes no initiative in directing her life and soaks up other"
,17,7,"TXT","10",0,0,"people’s ideas like a sponge to water. The example regarding the “vague, passive girl” perpetuates an old stereotype that some naive soul may integrate into its view of women. And worse yet, a previously biased individual may use the example to support its outdated, preconceived notion that a REAL woman (i.e. a feminine and passive one) stays at home, likes it, and desires no other life. This notion also implies that women who eryoy working outside the home are not REAL women. I resent that implication."
,17,7,"TXT","11",0,0,"And the scary thing is, some people actually think that way."
,17,7,"TXT","12",0,0,"What modem woman would consciously define herself as weak and passive? It serves her no good pvurpose to describe herself in such negative terms, unless, of course, she plans to manipulate others to do her bidding and set back the women’s movement 25 years."
,17,7,"TXT","13",0,0,"Feminism, the attempt to accord women equal rights, often gets a bad rap. Such is the case in the Amfirigan. Heritftgg Pic-tionarv. It defines “feminism* as “militant advocacy of equal rights and status for women.* By describing the movement as militant, the editmrs attach a negative connotation to the term “feminism.* They in fact define “militant* as “fighting or warring; aggressive, especially in the service of some cause."" Those individuals described as militant are often seen as extremists, like environmentalists who chain themselves to trees. A militant image puts off many folks and detracts from society’s acceptance of any movement’s goals, let alone those of feminism."
,17,7,"TXT","14",0,0,"The images produced by words often affect how we interact and react to other people. If we ever intend to finish the effort to end discrimination against women, we need to alter how we define terms as they relate to them. I hate to sound “politically correct” and all that that term implies, but we need to reshape our society’s perceptions of women if we are ever to accept them as equal to men in status, rights and consideration. Dictionaries provide one means of shaping perceptions by spreading new definitions, and hopefully one day, society will actually integrate those meanings."

,17,8,"TXT","1",0,0,"Spring is here, and along with it the sounds of spring — birds singing, the wind blowing gently through the trees, and the delicate sound of jackhammers breaking up concrete at select locations throughout campus."
,17,8,"TXT","2",0,0,"While the first two melodies are arguably pleasing, the latter seems to have become a recurrent theme during spring quarter at Cal Poly, to the chagrin of students and faculty alike."
,17,8,"TXT","3",0,0,"The Daily understands that the improvement of this campus architecturally as well as academically is for the benefit of all, but the disruptions caused to the academic side of matters are threatening to become more than mere annoyance. The closing of the UDR for repairs and remodeling, for example, has not only forced on-campus residents to investigate new dining options but has also blocked a major path of access to the University Union and bottlenecked large groups of people between the UU and El Corral."
,17,8,"TXT","4",0,0,"Similar inconveniences cropped up last year when the new Business Building was being constructed. Lecturers near the northwest end of campus were forced to compete with the tumultuous levels of noise caused by construction work."
,17,8,"TXT","5",0,0,"One has to question the appropriateness of doing this t3q>e of work at times which coincide with class sessions. Ever-in-creasing fees and overburdening class loads are already giving Cal Poly students headaches; we don’t need the added pressure on our eardrums from external sources as well."
,17,8,"TXT","6",0,0,"Would it be possible to save the majority of heavy construction until times when there are fewer students on campus, like summer quarter or during quarter breaks?"
,17,8,"TXT","7",0,0,"Perhaps some of the irritation caused by these construction capers might be more tolerable if someone could give us a completion date we could look forward to. The finishing date for the new Rec Center has been changed more times than a senior student’s CAPTURE schedule, causing more than one grumble among the fitness-minded."
,17,8,"TXT","8",0,0,"Construction workers are rarely, if ever, asked to work during a bombing raid; Cal Poly students shouldn’t be asked to learn under circumstances just as destructive to the educational environment."

,17,10,"TXT","1",0,0,"The budget crisis in California is very unfortunate; however, the continued reductions of classes and services is not a reasonable solution. The downward spiral resulting from mediocrity in the public schools can only perpetuate the problems California now faces. Of all the public programs which require vast amounts of money to maintain, none is more vital to the continued prosperity of the state than education."
,17,10,"TXT","2",0,0,"Another problem which comes to mind is the attitude of some instructors and administration officials. Overheard staffers often joke about how education is one of the few professions where you can get “cheat the customer” and they, the customer, doesn’t mind. Examples include shortened and/or canceled classes. Many students love when professors call classes off, yet truth be told, the time and money wasted on these “free rides” are irreplaceable."
,17,10,"TXT","3",0,0,"The incessant excuses offered up by the California State University system regarding the ever increasing tuition fees are not valid. Laws had to be changed to allow the dramatic increases we students have seen in the past two years. Administration claims that we, as Cal State system students, are getting one of the best deals in education in the United States will not be true for much longer, if they are even true now. Raising fees just because we are “getting a deal” as compared to other schools is not a valid reason."
,17,10,"TXT","4",0,0,"Judging from the general lack of conviction when it comes to standing up for students’ rights here at"
,17,10,"TXT","5",0,0,"Cal Poly, I can only foresee the continued rise of tuition fees and falling educational standards. “The roll over and take it” attitude of Poly students can only add to the further decline of a once valued degree."
