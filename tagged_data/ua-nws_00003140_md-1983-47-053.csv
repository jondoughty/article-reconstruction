1646,12,3,"TXT",1,0,0,"Jim Austin's letter on the antiwar movement {Mustang Daily 1/11/83) was disappointing but unsurprising. It was disappointing in the sense that he revealed a complete lack of ' understanding of tbs antiwar movement; it was unsurprising in that he merely reflected the predominantly conservative attitudes that accompany a widespread political unconsciousness."
1647,12,3,"TXT",2,0,0,"His criticism of the movement begins, of course, with gross oversimpliBcations of its belief and attitudes. He mistakenly characterizes the â€œpeaceâ€ movement as a â€œhateâ€ movement by saying that iwotestors hated everyone over 30, that minority groups hated whites, that women's liberationists hated men, that ecologists hated science and technology, etc. Hue series of assertions is prejudicial, blatantly false, and based upon a shallow examination of the facts. Protestors did not hate everyone over 30; they hated shortsighted, warmongering policies that were 1) established by local, state, and national governments, 2) rooted in self-interest and self-aggrandizement. 3) philosophically grounded in the specious post-WW II belief that America was â€œthe protector of the FVee World,â€œ and 4) usually formed by middle-aged men. Minorities did not hate whites; they hated the prejudice and discrimination that were levied against them by whites. Womenâ€™s liberstionists did not hate men; they hated the traditional belief system (fostered by men) that locked them into roles as housewives and baby machines. The ecology movement did not (and does not) hate science and technology; it hates the unthinking use of science and technology to the detriment of our precariously-balanced ecosystem. These were and are the real issues, and they sould not be obscured by flippant, coercive rhetoric."
1648,12,3,"TXT",3,0,0,"Further, although it is true (as Austin implies) that some factions of the antiwar movement were composed of radical â€œfringeâ€ groups-the Weather"
1649,12,3,"TXT",4,0,0,"Underground and the Black Panthers, for example-the movement as a whole cannot be characterized by their activities any more than the Republicans can be characterized by the actions and beliefs of Jerry Falwell or Anita Bryant (or even Richard Nixon). Confusing the mwits of an issue with the character of one of its spokesmen shows weak thinking. something Mr. Austin de^nstrates repeatedly."
1650,12,3,"TXT",5,0,0,"Perhaps the most blatant example of this is found in his concluding paragraph. Ignoring for the moment Austinâ€™s indirect assertion that McGovern lost the 1972 election because the antiwar movement supported him (again, an extreme oversimplification of the facts), and also ignoring Austinâ€™s rather bizarre assumption that electing Nixon was a testament to the wisdom of the American public, we are left with his statement that â€œthe abolishing of the military draft and President Nixonâ€™s wind down of the Vietnam War took much of the wind from the sails of the movement.â€ Think about it. This is equivalent to saying that â€œgranting women the vote took much of the wind from the sails of the suffrage movement.â€™!| That makes sense; when you accomplish your goals, there isnâ€™t much need to continue pursuing them."
1651,12,3,"TXT",6,0,0,"Face it. The antiwar movement was a success. Despite Nixon's invasion (whoops, I mean â€œincursionâ€) into Cambodia and his rhetoric about â€œpeace with honorâ€ and â€œhonorable withdrawalâ€ (slogans even mme mindless than â€œlove and peaceâ€), the weight and strength of Amwican opinion was overwhelmingly against the war, and American opinion forced him to mid it. Contending that the American public ignored, loathed, and despised the antiwar movement (as Austin does) ignores historical fact and the flow of current events."

1656,12,4,"TXT",1,0,0,"While many of the budget cuts that Governor Deukmejian has ordered are frightening and unfair, that lack of appropriation of funds sufficient to ke^ Cal Poly in session during the summer, in addition to the former chargee, is downright stupid."
1657,12,4,"TXT",2,0,0,"It is true that taking Cal Poly out of function during the summer quarter would serve as an immediate cost reduction, but what would the consequences of this be. Today, many Cal Poly students do not plan to use only the traditional four times three quarters to graduate. The summer sessions, however, have so far provided an excellent opportunity for students to graduate within four years an3rway. If that opportunity is removed, many students will have to delay their graduations and thereby stay longer in the facility. The result heraof hardly constitute any savings per student although, of course, it will mean that there will be room for less new students. At a university that is already impacted, I wonder if anyone in his right mind could justify this."
1658,12,4,"TXT",3,0,0,"Another question is that of efficiency and appropriate utilization of the facilities and equipment that the university possesses uid will continue to possess over the summer. Considering the fact that majors such as computer sdsnee are greatly impacted, the facilities in these dq>artments should be used to their fullest. Of course, the sight of an â€œemptyâ€ campus over the summer would also be a heartbreaking one."
1659,12,4,"TXT",4,0,0,"Finally, it seems that the timing of the consideration to cancel the summer quarter is very irresponsible. 0>nsider-ing the fact that many students have to plan ahead, a five and a half month warning is clearly insufficient. Then again, who knew that we would get Deukmejian as governor?"
1660,12,4,"TXT",5,0,0,"I urge all concerned students and faculty members to write Goveri^r George Deulanejian (State Capitol, Sacramento. CA 96814) and ask that sufficient funds be reinstated to maintain the sununar quarter. Part of these funds might be obtained by selling the Governorâ€™s mansion. Then again, we all have different priorities."
