The Soviet government doesn’t want its people to know what Americans have that Soviets don’t, she added. So not only are Soviet citizens “discouraged’’ from making contact with foreigners, but foreigners, Americans in particular, are “discouraged’’ from rubbing elbows with the natives."

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s recent policy of openness is changing things rapidly in Russia and the rest of the USSR, Rosenthal said.
