464,7,14,"TXT",3,0,0,"The Mustangs travel to exotic downtown Bakersfield for the California Collegiate. Athletic Association ^championships this afternoon and Saturday. At stake will be not only the conference title and bragging rights for a year, but also a legion of individual matchups that will most probably be replayed at the national championships in Macomb, 111. in two weeks.	--t,"

469,7,14,"TXT",7,0,0,"Said Miller, ""According to the conference listing alone, Northridge could score 14 in the long jump, 17 in the triple jump, 12 in the discus and 21 in the hammer. They could be competitive without winning an event.”"
