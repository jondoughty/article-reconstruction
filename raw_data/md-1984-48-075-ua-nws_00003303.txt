Concert facilities needed for Cal Poly
by Nancy LmtIs
SfMcUH to thf Oflf
   The ASI Concert Committee is still without a facility in which to hold concerts, and the chance to sign performers to a concert at Cal Poly before June is slipping away.
   The Concert Committee, a part of the ASI Program Board, has been without a facility to hold concerts since October when Jim Hailey, Physical Education department head, refused to allow any more concerts in the gymnasium until further guidelines of gymnasium procedures could be drawn up.
                                                                                                                                 The Concert Committee chaired by Jerry Morales and Bailey along with Harry Busselen. the dean of the School of Human Development and Education, have up with guidelines acceptable to the thfoe of
them, but are waiting for approval from the university’s Facility Use Committee.
   The Facility Uae Committee la a standing committee chaired by Provost Tomlinson Fort, Jr. Its function is to interpret regulations concerning the use of campus facilities. The group only meets on call as issues arise, according to Morales.
   Morales said he and the rest of the Concert Committee members have been waiting two weeks for the Facility Use Committee to make a general endorsement of the- new guidelines for concert procedures, and will probably wait another week while the members of the Facility Use Committee respond to a proposal Fort sent to each of the members.
   If the committee members generally agree to the new guidelines, the Concert Committee can bid on performers for possible concerts on campus spring
quarter, according to Morales.                 ,
   The situation is frustrating for the 106-member Concert Committee because until the committee has a guaranteed facility to use, it cannot enter any contracts with a performing group, Morales said.
   “We won’t even consider bidding, which means Concerts is at a standstill,’’ remarked Morales. "It's very frustrating for the committee because we haven’t been able to do anything about concerts. As a result we’re going to lose out on a lot of acts.’’
   Morales said the performers that are available before June have been finalizing their tour dates over the past two weeks. As a consequence. Cal Poly’s, chance of contracting one of these acts is getting slimmer as they wait for the Facility Uae Committee to makes decision.
                                                                                                                                                                                       Please see page 5

Six more instructors arrested in latest of Diabto protests
by Jaaaa Chavarria
Staff Witter
   Eleven members df Concerned Cal Poly Faculty, Staff and Friends were arrested Saturday as approximately 1-.000 demonstrators protested against the Diablo Crayon Nuclear Power Plant.
   Mote than 60 arrests were made over the weekend in the largest rally at Avila Beach since Jan, llof this year,
                                                                                                                                                                      »w fherfuUH far tndey
at a pjn. at the Veteran’s Memorial Halt The eleven members an charged with tnepasaing and refusal to disperse.
   Paul Wolff, acting as a spokesman for the group, explained that those arrested would likely be given the choice of paying a fine of 6185 or spending four days in jail. They are currently being held in the Sen Luis Obispo County Jail.
   “None of the people in the group will pay the fine,” said Wolff. “Most of the group will plead not guilty and try and use the defense of necessity.’'
   Defense of necessity is where a person commits a crime in order to prevent a greater crime, said Wolff. He explained that this defense has never been allowed in a civil disobedience cam but would set an important precedent if it were allow-<*•
   Each person is allowed to make a statement to the court during the arraignments. said Wolff.
   “They should ha interesting especially to students,” ha added.
   Thom faculty members arrested are: William dark, mechanical engineering; David Enghind, child development; Jim Hauser, physics; Richard Kranzdorf, political science; Bette Tryon, child development; end Walter Tryon, landscape architecture.
   The people in the group that represent staff and friends are: Rich Hubbard, Randy Hutton, Joanna Verhaard, and Gloria Zimmerman. Two Cal Poly students also arrested are Lola Arnold, child development major, and a student that refused to give his name, but was not associated with the group.
   Jim Hauser is the only faculty member that was arrested at both the Jan. 13 protest and last weekend according to Wolff.
   This most recent protest wee spurred by the fact that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is holding hearings on whether or not to grant Diablo Canyon a low-level testing license.
Student senators to decide *™ight on peace resolution
Sarah Longatraet, age 6, looks more serious than moat Poly students as aha stands on Poly View Drive.
* ' 1 .. ............................................

   ‘ ■                  4
   The Student Senate tonight is voting on a Pasco Package which would send a message to the California Legislature that Cal Poly students support the Legislature’s peace resolution.
   If the Student Senate passes the Peace Package said Julie Clayton, author of the resolution and senator from Human Development and Education, it would send e letter to Sen Lula Obispo’s representatives that 16,000 students support the Legislature’s resolution.
   The Legislature’s resolution, if passed, would tend s message to the United States Senate urging them to call for the immediate halt to the deployment of nuclear weapons.
   The resolution also calls for a letter to be sent to Congress and the President of the United States urging them to increase peace making efforts and dialogue in order to decrease United States/Soviet Union tension.
( One reason for her resolution was to increase the knowledge of Student Senators, she said. “My underlying purpose is to increase the awareness of the Student Senate, councils and dubs.’’
   When a resolution or bill is introduced she said, the senate, the student councils and dubs must study the proposal and this increases their awareness of the social issues.
   Many senators have been critical of resolutions which do not directly relate to education, calling for the senate to address issues which only affect students’ education.
   “I don’t think my resolution will pass,” said Clayton. “Because there is a lot of confusion among Student Senators as to their roles as senators and citizens of the United States.’’
   Clayton said that she will continue to introduce tjills and resolutions which are of great importance to Cel Poly students as citizens of the United States.
   “I’m not pushing my political viewpoints on anyone,’’ Please era page 9

Actioiis say more than words
        Itojjfeltad Stated and tha Soviet Union ate two bahamoths in a faceoff.
        We ate like two old stags. Neither of ue wants to fight but neither wanta to back down either. We are at an iwy— that haa lasted for decades and the tenaion is not abating-/
        Efforts have been .made in the past to try to relieve some of that tension. Opportunities have occasionally arisen in which we had a chance to better relations with each other. We took advantage of some. On other occasions we blew it.
        We have another of those opportunities now. The death of the president of the Soviet Union resulted in the appointment of a new Soviet leader, Konstantin U. Chernenko.
        The late Yuri V. Andropov, for whatever reasons, was either unable or unwilling to negotiate much with the United States. The new leader comes from a different element of the Soviet top eschelon and it is hoped by Washington that he will be more willing to cooperate in achieving some progress toward peace.
        Washington can talk all it wants, but it is actions that count. The Soviets will be watching us more narrowly than ever during this time of transition. How interested they are in talking with the United States will hinge on what they see us saying and doing in the international theater.
        It is up to us to keep our noses clean. President Reagan has indicated a desire to improve ties between our nation and the USSR. But words don't carry much weight in the Soviet Union. They don’t trust us any more than we trust them. It is what we do that counts.
        Our government in Washington needs to decide whether it is more important to scurry around the world interfering in this revolution or that civil war, ship arms to Western Europe, or to back off and demonstrate our seriousness in wanting to discuss peace.
        We do not need to hamstring our defenses to show the Russians we mean business. But they will take us much more seriously if President Reagan shows them, not just tells them, that America wants to achieve a mutually acceptable peaceful relationship with the Soviet Union.

 Ignorant pen calls Student Senate ASInine
  As Student Senators from the School of Human Development and Education we wish to address your Feb. 6,1964 Opinion page calling us ASInine. To begin with, let us set the record straight. The Editorial Board stated that “...only one fourth of the 24 senators have even introduced bills. The remaining bills ware authored by ASI officers, who cannot even vote on them “ You are correct in stating that a small percentage of senators have introduced bills. The majority of business that is conducted at the senate meetings is in the form of rssolutitms and not bills. We might aimast that you know the difference between thetwobeforeyougo writing with an “ignorant’’pan.
  As far as the senate evaluation form is concerned, we agree with the Editorial Board. It was ASInine. I, Julie Clayton, along with half the other aehators felt that filling out the evaluation form Would not be a “worthwhile invsetment of our time.’’
  The Daily abo suggesta that “perhapa student senators need to have their qualifications checked before they are oven allowed to run for office.” The point is writ taken but what type of qualifications are
t^niMid^ichoob.
  As far as genie being set; we can only speak for ourselves. I feel that I have obtained essay of my goele as an ASI Student Senator. My foremost goal waa to
critically analyse the ASI Finance Committee's fun-
ding of events at Cal Poly. I have spoken out on ASI funds being allocated to put on a “tailgate” party and also ASI funds spent to fly not one but two ASI officers to the East Coast for lobbying purposes. • }
   My fellow student senator, Donna TsnigucbL feels that the objective that she has wanted to address was that of increasing tha awareness of our student body on the current issues being dealt with. One important approach is communicating this to students through the student councils.
   We have also set up a "inset your ASI Senator’’ Day. During this day, we met with our constituents end passed out information on such things as the new add/drop policy and voter registration.
   I have, along with the help of the Student Senate, surveyed 600 Cal Poly students in order to find out how they would like to eee their commencement ceremony run. From the results of the survey. I introduced and had passed a resolution reflecting the majority's opinion.
   Finally. I have spent a day at our State Capitol lobbying for an increase in funding for the California State University System’s budget. Hie list goes on and on but perhaps we would not need to waste the ink on this page ifthe Editorial Board had cared enough to sit in on one of our many senate meetings in order to find out what we were up to.
   The Student Senate meets for a formal masting every Wednesday night form 7 pjn.en.1 can roeatiene
meeting in which the Student Senate eat from 7 p.m. til midnight discussing pertinent, issues that would affect the Cel Poly student body. We meet (informally) every Monday night to debate raoohitions and bills before they are brought to the Wednesday night-meeting. We aleo attend our school council meetings and ait on various risnriiag committees such as: In-structkmally Related Activities Board (which extends fund to the Mustang DetfyA Codes and Bylaws and the Academic Committee.
   What does this all add up to? Roughly. 10 to 20 hours of voluntary service to the ASI. What do we receive in return? A slap in the face from the Editorial Board of tha Mustang Daily!
   Julie Clayton Dsana Tanlgndri
Editors note:
   The Mustang Daily is completely self-sufficient and is supported only by those revenues it generates in advertising. None of its funding comes from IRA, as erroneously stated in the above letter. L          ;
   And once again you have missed the point of the editorial Speahing out against an action is fine and dandy, but what specific actions (resolutions do not count — they're merely recommendations) hew the Student Senate accomplished which hew directly affected the student body of Cal Pofyl

Past concert problems cause request Tor change

  From page 1
  The bands that are still available for possible concerts before June include John Cougar, Elvis Costello, Roy Orbison, .38 Special and U2, said Morales.
  No more concerts have been held in the gym since October when Railey put a halt to them. Railey’s concern came after the Motels and X concerts.
  These concerts didn’t cause specific problems, but according to Morales, it was the last straw for Railey in dealing with concerts over the years. “He got to a point where be had to stop and evaluate the situation," said Morales.
  “There were some concerns he had that we didn't know were causing problems," said Morales. The biggest issue was the use of the gym floor.
  In the past, the Concert Committee has tried to control the entry of people wearing hard-soled shoes on the floor, the amount of smoking and the abuse of the gym floor. “However with 3,000 people in there with a sold-out concert, it’s almost inevitable someone will light up a cigarette.” said Morales.
  Railey feels the facility was built as a physical education area and the use of the facility should be for those purposes. "The gym was not built for concerts, it was built for participatory activities," he said.
  But the Concert Committee still needs a facility, said Morales. “We understand it is a f 11 pings to be able to use it, and we feel we can work together since we don’t have one to use," he said.
  One of Railey’s biggest complaints was a gouge in the wooden floor that was taken out when the stage platform was moved in for the Motels concert.
  “The gouge is thare forever, because wa can’t sand it out," said Rjuley.
  To protect the floor in the future, guidelines state a plastic floor covering will be laid across the floor from bleacher to bleacher for all sit down concerts.
  Shoe checks will also be more strictly enforced to prevent hard-soled shoos, and smoking, food and drink will be forbidden in the gym.
  Another problem is caused by the lobby doors being blocked during concerts, said Railey. Previously, the

Poly loses out on concerts for lack of facilities
Frontpage*
lobby doors hava baan used aa an entry for madia, but this mads it difficult for any faculty who wanted to enter thair offices during a concert.
   Hailey said that the last few concerts have been held on Sunday and Monday nights when faculty would be using their offices. “It causes a special problem for coaches who work seven days a week during the season,” ha added.
   Guidelines now state that the media door will be moved to the main entrance so as not to obstruct entry to the lobby of the gym. A security officer will be stationed at the media door as well. ^
   Railey said he is still concerned about the entire building being shut down for a concert being held in one area of the building. “Students by the droves come in to workout on the weekends and dosing the building obstructs their right to use the building,” he said. No solution for that problem is stated in the guidelines.
   Performers have also abused parts of the building, according to Railey. He said rooms used by the performers have smelled so strongly of marijuana that “instructors reported that they couldn't breathe."
   As a result, the wrestling room will no longer be used as a snack bar and classrooms will no longer be used as dressing rooms for performers and concert workers. Instead, trailers or motor homes, when needed, will be moved to the back of the gym for dressing or rest areas for the performers, guidelines state.
   Other guidelines deal with crowd control procedures. Because of police concern, concert-goers will not be allowed to line up for concerts until four hours before the performance. That lineup used to be able to start at 6 a.m. the morning of the concert, but Railey believes that encourages people to bring coolers and motivates them to “get bombed out and throw up during the concert.”
   For crowd control procedures, guidelines state professional security groups will continue to be hired for large-scale concerts to help control concert-goers, prevent smoking, prevent disruptive behavior and pre-
  vent illegal activity like the use of drugs, alcohol or ; any campus violation.
    Other new procedures included in the list of guidelines refer to specific dean up duties to be completed by the Concert Committee after the concerts.
    Morales said the Concert Committee has investigated alternative sites to hold a concert, but none is as good as the gym.
    Chumash Auditorium has been cancelled out as a possible site for two reasons, said Morales. The auditorium is small, so the performers would have to stage two shows in order for the Concert Committee to break even. Morales also thinks there is not enough in-treet in small groups at a concert.
    The second reason, said Morales, is the weak floor. No dances can be held in the auditorium because of the floor, and many of the concerts encourage dancing.
    Morales said the committee has considered holding another concert in the University Union Plaza like it did last year with the Plimsoula and Kingbees. If permission is granted for an outdoor concert, Morales . thinks the concert could be controlled and planned in such a way that it would end early.
    Several nearby residents, including President Warren Baker, complained of the noise from the concert last year. "I still hope in the future we can have another outdoor concert.” said Morales, “maybe in Poly Grove.”
    The Concert Committee even checked alternative sites off campus such as the Cuesta College gym, but problems exist with that solution also, said Morales.
    Both gyms on Cuesta College campus seat 1,600 lees people than the Cal Poly gym, he said, adding it is also difficult to get the buildings for ues.
    “We missed out on holding a Madness concert on March 2 because of paper work," said Morales. According to him, the Concert Committee asked to use one of the gyms at Cuesta. Cuesta officials were hesitant because the gyms are rarely rented out for outside use, but they made an exception and granted it.
    “By the time we got approval and got back to the
agent, we were a day late. The agent had accepted another group's bid," said Morales. “It just took too long to get the gym at Cuesta."
   Poly Canyon was another alternative site for a concert, said Morales, but security would be impossible to control and the road to the canyon is not big enough to carry the equipment.
Peace issue in Senate
From page 1
         she said. But as elected student leaders she said, we should take stands on issues which affect everyone.
   The senate is also scheduled to vote on s resolution which recommends that students entering University of California or State Universities be allowed to fulfill e foreign language requirement in high school or through a proficiency test if a student hasn't taken a foreign language in high school.
   The Academic Senate recently passed a similar bill, said Senator Kevin Creighton, author of the resolution. A state-wide entrance requirement which can be fulfilled by students in high school is a better way to deal with the requirement, he added.
   The Student Senate meeting starts tonight at 7 p.m. in UU 220 and all students are invited to attend and address the senate.

   Ag Forum addresses "hidden

   Dr. Wm Jackson, director of tho Land Institute la Selina, Kansas said that 99% of all university research support* capital intensive agriculture with an emphasis on enorgy rather than ecology.
   Jackaon said reaearch money la coming from chemical companiea so that “energy inputs have ^fniLigiral mechanisms ”
   He feels the school of agriculture and biological science need to break traditional patterns of specialization and merge together their research data from both I fields to improve the problems in agriculture.
   Stein noted that sustainable agriculture is still in its infancy, with basic research just being started.
   In order for it to work, members believe, a greater understanding and cooperation with all life forces needs to exist.
   People need to develop farms as small ecosystems Stein said. Where animal manure can be used to fertilise soil which feeds the animals. To prevent erosion and a loos of nutrients, crops can be rotated. Farmers can use smaller tractors to get the job done and con-

  Like nature, the costs are cychcaL Farms are sprayed with pesticidss and insect iridss which in turn leach into the soil with winter raina. Man consumes animals that have eaten chemically treated grasses. The end result is contamination of the drinking water and a higher incidence of cancer in humans.
  Jerry Harbinson, a graduate student said that every time an oQ shortage occurs, the cost of fertilizer skyrockets, which in turn brings up tho cost of food.
  “The pries of lettuce on your table shouldn't be dependent on a barrel of ojl,“ he said.
  Ag Forum believes big forms have never boon assessed on the hidden coete and support taxing farmers for the mismanagement of farm fond.

UCSB research shuttle up for Baker’s approval
   A proposal up for approval by President Baker and the Academic Senate would make it possible for Cal Poly researchers to use the library resources at the University of California Santa Barbara.
   Under the terms of the proposal a free shuttle would be provided between the two universities for people who meet researcher qualifications. Library officials would determine who meets the requirements.

   The proposal encourages faculty to pursue research activities and notes that the nearest forge research center is at UCSB.
   Gamble said that Cal Poly officials would not necessarily have to buy a new vehicle. “Administrators could set up a shuttle with a state car or van,” she explained.
   Gamble added that the muttle should operate between normal working hours, possible leaving Poly at 7 a.m. and returning by 5 pm.
   However, schedules could be flexible, said Gamble. If researchers made prior arrangements for living quarters, researchers could take edvantage of UC Santa Barbara's library for more than a, day.
   The acadmic senate is expected to vote ou the library shuttle proposal at its next meeting, March 6. According to Academic Senate chairman Jim Simmons, the proposal appeared to have met senate members' approval. -                          u

   On a cold, windy Saturday afternoon, the Cal Poly women’s swim team finished their dual medt season undefeated, drowning the University of Pacific, 64-41.
   Senior All-American Ann Stier led the Mustangs with three victories. two of which qualified her for the nationals to be held in New York on March 7. Stier broke the Imutmt in the 600 free (5:06.35) and the 400 individual medley (4:44.29). She also won' the 100 fly with a tine of 1*1.90.
   “Ann had pome good swims,” said coach Duane McRoy. “She gutted out the 500 for a great'time.”
   Teammate Anne Gatlin, who has aheady qualified for nationals in three events and two relays, won the 100 back with a time of 1:04.42, and broke the 39-
second barrier in the 50 back (29.65) in an exhibition swim.
   Other individual winners for the Mustangs included: JoanMary Laubacher, 50 free (25.79): Susan Watt, 100 free (56.19): Nancy Stem, 200 Breast (2:33.50): and Jennifer Shofiekl, 200 free (2:12.89).
   In diving, Donna McRoy fought off the bad weather to qualify for nationals on the one-meter board with a total of 363 points.
   With nationals less than a month away, the Mustangs already have eight girls qualified to compete in a total of 18 events.
   The Mustangs have also attained standards in the 400 medley relays and 800 free relays, but their 200 free, and 200 medley relays have yet to qualify. The last chance to make the trip to New York will be in two weeks in a meet to be held in the USC Olympic pool.

Janet Lehman helped the Cal Poly gymnastics team to a win at home last weekend against three other schools.
by Kathy Messlnger
Staff Writer
   The Cal Poly women's gymnastics team outdueied their competition to win their first home meet last weekend with their highest score of the year in front of a capacity crowd at Crandall Gym.
   Poly's team score of 164.65 tops their previous best score of this season by four points. Cal Poly Pomona was second with 156.5 points, Sbuthern Utah State was third with 136.3, and San Francisco State was fourth with 81.25.
   "The girls were great. This was their best meet—they were really working as a team," said coach Tim Rivera. “This is the first time we have had a full team (six girls! on each event.”
   In the all-around event Poly outshined the competition. Jana Lehman, freshman, placed first with her highest all-around score this season, with a 34.1. Kaxumi Norimoto. senior, who competed in the all-around for the first time this season by adding a floor routine was second with a score of 33.45 and Lisa McAllister tied for third with a score of 32.7.
   Also in the all-around were Cathy Pagani with a score of 30.25 and Denise Stretch with a score of 29.65.
   Poly’s first event of the evening, the vault, was won by Norimoto with a score of 8.4, Teryl Theis was second with an 8.35, Lehman was third with an 8.3 and McAllister was fourth with an 8.25.
   Other scores on the vault were, Stretch with a 7.7 and Pagani with a 7.3.
   On the uneven parallel bars McAllister won the event with a score of 8.76, Lehman was second with a score of 8.7 and Norimoto was fourth with an 8.5.
   Theis scored an 8.15 on the bars. Stretch scored a 7.5 and Pagani scored a 6.2.
   Despite a fall during warm-ups before the meet, in
which Norimoto bruised her shoulder falling off of the bars, she still held on to do well in the meet.
    i he girls improved on their form, I was impressed. They all stuck their landings,” said Rivera. “Two tenths of a point is taken off for each extra step on a landing, to many can really hurt the team as well as individual scores,” said Rivera.
  On the beam. Poly took a clean sweep of the top three places. Pagani was first with an 8.6, Norimoto was second with an 8.5 and Lehman was third with an 8.3.
  Other scores were Pam Dickie with a 7.75, McAllister with a 7.35 and Stretch with a 6.9.
  Pagani was the only Poly gymnast not to fall off of the beam during her routine. "Five-tenths of a point is taken off for every fall, this can take a 9 point routine down to a 7.5 with just three falls.” said Rivera.
  “The routines were very clean, everyone was solid. That 8 why the falls didn’t hurt the scores as much as they could have," said Rivera.
  On the floor exercise Lehman had the highest score given out on any event, she was first with a score of 8.85, tumbling to the sound of Beethoven's Fifth symphony. McAllister was third with an 8.35 dispite an unfortunate fall on the last move of her first tumbling ran.
  Theis had a score of 8.2 on the floor. Pagani scored an 8.16, Norimoto scored an 8.06 and Stretch scored a 7.45.
  Norimoto needed an all-around score for regionals, the routine she did was put together just last week during practice.
  “This was a real high energy meet, by my doing a floor routine we added assurance in obr final team score for the floor,” said Norimoto. “This was the best meet ever We really worked together as a team,” agreed Lehman and Pagani.
  The next home meet for Poly is March 3, and the girls all agreed that this was the best audience that they had competed in front of all season.
