Students saddle western values
Beginning riding class at Poly draws large numbers
Hy Kelli Harris
Staff Writer
The morning of Nov. 1 is like none other throughout the year, at least out at the Horse Unit’s Breeding Barn.
On this day, the barn is overrun by a slew of camped-out students, making the stone-floored building look more like a BASS ticket center than Cal Poly’s equine reproduction unit.
But the tickets these students are waiting for aren’t for any concert, but for the chance to enroll as one of 45 students in Animal Science 131, Beginning Western Riding.
“I thought I was going to be the only one out there at 3
o’clock, but there was already a line by the time I got to the bam,” said Jamie Ramirez, a home economics senior, thinking back on that cold morning.
The class, only offered during winter quarter, fills up each year, despite a $150 lab fee.
Instructors Roger Hunt and Gene Armstrong have more than 45 years of combined experience teaching and working with horses.
This class has three sections, Tuesday and Thursday from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m. to noon; Monday, Wednesday, Friday 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.; and Monday, Wednesday, Friday 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The three-unit class includes a
textbook, homework assignments and hands-on experience.
“A lot of people do things for money,” said Armstrong, a 1966 Cal Poly animal science graduate. “But this is something I like to do. I’ve been around horses all of my life. I can never remember not being around livestock.
“Beginning Western Riding provides the opportunity to gain horse experience, which can be used in other animal science classes or just for pleasure,” Armstrong said.
The class teaches beginners and those with limited experience techniques for grooming, riding skills, care and feed-Scc RIDING CLASS, page 8
Director shares plan for ethnic studies
Focus on visibility, diversity to head program changes
By Julie Pacheco
Staff Writer
His students at Northern Iowa State University knew him as Pawoko, a Native American name given to a captive Condor chick.
“Pawoko is a Chumash word that means first to leave the nest,” Pawoko said. “It’s a power word that I adopted for my students to use when they needed a little extra energy.”
At Cal Poly, Pawoko is better known as Bob Gish, the university’s new director of the ethnic studies program.
Gish, who is of Native American heritage, left, his position at Northern Iowa after 25 years to come to San Luis Obispo.
“I was attracted to Cal Poly because I love the American West,” Gish said. “And how much further west can you go than California?”
Tlie first thing Gish would like to do here is bring about educational equity.
“The American experience is a bunch of diverse experiences mingled together,” Gish said. “The stress of this program will be on the ethnic American culture. A community through diversity is the most desirable outcome.”
Gish’s plans for changes in the Cal Poly curriculum include a general education requirement in ethnic studies.
Tb do this, Gish will be working closely with the General Education and Breadth Committee, co-chaired by political science professor John Culver.
“As of now we have not reached any final decisions,” Culver said. “Bob Gish, the GE&B
Committee and a subcommittee for general education will work together to implement the courses.”
Culver said he expects the ball to begin rolling for the ethnic studies program by the end of the quarter.
The program will focus on four different American cultural experiences, including African-American, Native American, Mexican-American and Asian-American.
“Although Cal Poly has not moved as far as it should, at least it is moving forward now.”
Bob Gish, director of
ethnic studies program
Gish said the fact that Cal Poly is the last school in the CSU system to implement an ethnic studies program should not be looked upon negatively.
“Although Cal Poly has not moved as far as it should, at least it is moving forward now,” Gish said. “It’s important to accentuate the positive and move in that direction.”
Along those lines, the next step, Gish said, will be to begin a program leading to a minor in ethnic studies and eventually work toward implementing a major.
Gish also plans to create an Ethnic Studies Committee that will communicate between faculty, students and the administration.
The problem with the ethnic studies program now is that it is not visible to most of Cal Poly’s students and faculty, Gish said.

Poly dean blasts government intervention in business
By Carol Boosembark
Staff Writer
Cal Poly’s new dean of the School of Business, Bill Boyes, challenged members of a local women’s organization with some enlightening political beliefs during a lecture Monday evening.
With alarming statistics and fiery words, Boyes praised privatization and criticized the growth of governmental regulations and controls in America.
“What we are doing doesn’t make any sense,” Boyes said emphatically to the Five Cities-Pismo Beach Branch of the American Association of University Women. “We need to break the strangle
hold of governmental control.”
Specifically, Boyes singled out the governmental regulations on small businesses in California.
“Californians, there is a potential for losing what you have!” Boyes said.
Although California could be called the eighth-largest country in the world, this state is losing many small businesses each year.
“In California there is an antientrepreneur, anti-newcomer attitude with its ‘welcome stranger’ taxes, water rationing,” Boyes said.
The vast number of permits and regulations required for small businesses are making it impossible to make a living in
California, he said.
Thrning to the regulations and controls exercised by the government nationwide, Boyes pushed for more privatization.
“Privatization doesn’t mean we get rid of it,” he said. “It just becomes more efficient.”
He believes privatization of the Department of Motor Vehicles, garbage collection, building inspectors, prisons, roads and education would increase efficiency and reduce expenses.
When questioned about the possibilities of toll roads, Boyes said, “Okay, we would pay tolls, but we are paying for something we are using.”
In addition, Boyes believes the govern-
ment should end farm subsidies.
“The average farmer is a millionaire,” he said. He later clarified this statement, saying the assets and land plus the income earned equaled $1,000,000.
Government spending in the tobacco industry was another mystery to Boyes. He questioned the logic behind allocating government money to tobacco subsidies, antismoking campaigns, cancer research, breast cancer research and then adding a cigarette tax.
“We have got to demand the government treat us better,” Boyes said. “The government does a bad job of spending our money.”

Koreas agree not to have nuclear weapons
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The two Koreas exchanged signed texts Tuesday of a historic agreement intended to keep nuclear arms out of their region and requiring the Communist North to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program.
Meanwhile, South Korean newspapers reported the United States and North Korea would hold their first-ever meeting of high-ranking officials in New York on Jan. 22.
Indian reservations Visually impaired man may pay property tax sues race organizers
WASHINGTON (AP) — States and counties may impose property taxes on Indian reservation land privately owned by Native Americans, the Supreme Court ruled today.
By an 8-1 vote, the justices upheld such a tax imposed by Yakima County, Wash., on land within the Yakima Indian Reservation.
But, by a separate, unanimous vote, the court barred the county from imposing an excise tax on the sale of such privately owned — or “fee” — land.
SACRAMENTO (AP) — A visually impaired Sacramento athlete is suing Eppie s Great Race for barring him last year from part of the triathlon because of his disability.
John Adams said in his suit filed in Sacramento Superior Court that race directors refused to allow him to participate in the bicycle portion of the July event. He says he offered to ride with a guide or apart from other cyclists.

Sexual abuse counseling expands
By Katherine Gill
Staff Writer
Cal Poly’s Status of Women Committee is seeking applicants to work as volunteer advocates for sexual harassment and sexual assault survivors.
Wendy Demko Reynoso, a member of the Status of Women Committee, said the committee felt there was a need for more than just the sexual harassment advisers now available.
“Right now there are only advisers, and it’s not their role to encourage or take sides,” she said.
Nan Byars, an engineering technology professor and cochairperson of the Status of Women Committee, said the advocate job is quite different from that of the sexual harassment adviser in that the advocate does take a side.
“An adviser has to stay neutral in a case,” Byars said. “All an adviser can do is tell survivors what their options are. Clearly someone who has gone through something like sexual harassment or assault is going to need support. That is what the advocate is for, to be supportive.”
Byars said advocates will accompany survivors to meetings and hearings, and be there for them when they need someone to
listen.
“We’re looking for people who have the time to help out, and who are knowledgeable ed>out sexual harassment and sensitive to the issue,” Byars said. “Mostly, we are looking for caring people who can be sensitive and supportive.”
Byars said the committee is looking for men and women to be
“Mostly, we are looking for caring people who can be sensitive and supportive.”
Nan Byars committee co-chairperson
advocates because sexual harassment and assault happens to both males and females.
Though no fixed number has been set, Byars said the program will probably need 10 to 12 volunteers.
Byars added that the committee is interested in faculty and staff members only.
“Students pass through the school quickly. They’re not here
for very long,” she said. “What we want for the program is continuity. We need people who will stay.”
Advocates will go through a training program to prepare them for their job, Byars said.
“We’re not going to just throw them in and tell them to go help somebody,” she said. “We will train them.”
Reynoso said the committee wants the volunteers to undergo the same training as advisers. The number of advocates who will be allowed to go through the adviser training is one of the things still being ironed out, she said.
Volunteer advocates’ names and phone numbers will be added to sexual harassment flyers that are given to people who are seeking help for harassment problems. Survivors can then call an advocate if they feel they need help or support.
Reynoso said she hopes anyone who comes forward with a problem will be encouraged to call.
Reynoso said the advocate program will probably be ready to put in place by spring quarter.
Interested faculty and staff members should contact the Academic Senate office.
ETHNIC STUDIES
From page 1
“We need to mainstream the program as much as possible,” he said. “It is not a visibly packaged program. We need to give it some coherence, higher visibility, direction and focus.”
Another goal Gish has is to represent different cultures in all disciplines at Cal Poly.
“Cultural studies can be im-
plemented into many different disciplines,” Gish said.
“Architecture, agriculture and even science have different perspectives from each culture. Our idea is to develop courses for these disciplines as well.”
To do this, Gish will need the support from the present faculty at Poly.
Gish said he hopes that all
faculty can contribute to increasing awareness about the influence of ethnicity in everyday life,
“I’d like to see more integration not only in student activities, but in courses as well,” Gish said. “Minorities are not the only people we want to reach. It’s important for everyone to be exposed to different cultures.”

Sandy Miller, a member of AAUW, said she found Boyes’ lecture very interesting.
“I just kind of realized how
much the wool’s been pulled over our eyes from the media,” Miller said.
“Yes (the economy) is down, but we’re on the rise. The reces-
sion we had 10 years ago is worse than this one.
“I found that encouraging and a bit of an eye-opener,” she said.

THE U.U. AND YOU
Mustang Daily
Should Poly students have access to teacher evaluations?


Jennifer
Davis
English
Junior
I think evaluating teachers could be either a positive or negative thing. In a positive manner, I just transferred into the English major and I have no idea which professors are real good and which ones aren’t. I think it can be a positive thing to get the most out of your education.
From the negative aspect, I think students are obviously going to flock to the teachers they’ve heard are good. That will make the classes impacted and people are going to want to add those classes.
Overall I think it’s a tough choice.
A
Paul
Lee
Biochemistry
Junior

I think evaluations should be made available to the students so we can pick our teacher, but since CAf*TURE makes it impossible anyway, I guess it all doesn’t really matter much anyway.
It would be good to see them but I don’t think it would change much because classes are always full anyway.
ASI government should be in charge of getting it together and getting them out to students. It seems like they don’t get much done. What do they do, anyway? I never see any results. I guess they get money from our tuition so they should do it.

\
if
I would like to know what other students have to say about a teacher before I take them. A lot of times you don’t have the access or know someone that has taken a professor before and you’re faced with about four different teachers. An educated decision can make a difference in the course.
If they’re well-thought-out evaluations, they could give the good and the bad about a teacher and give everyone a more educated choice. Not that through CAPTURE you can really choose anyway, but overall it’s a good idea.



Matthew
Novak
English
Professor
I think it’s fine. I’m in favor of it. I think students deserve to know more directly instead of through the grapevine what teachers are really like.
They can get that through evaluations if they’re well done. The English department has a good evaluation form. Students find these things out anyway, don’t they? Why not just make it all available and eliminate the middleman.
ASI or another student organization might be responsible, I would think.

Mary
Linkenbach
Soil Science Sophomore
I think that we should definitely have instructor evaluations because it would help students make a choice that would improve their education. If they wanted a challenge they could take a difficult teacher. I don’t think hard teachers would be avoided because students basically want a good education.
I read that commentary about it (Mustang Daily, Jan. 10) and there should definitely be a special publication. It should be done by a club on campus, possibly ASI — but definitely not administrators. It would be a good reference for incoming freshmen — they could get a basic student opinion.
Karen
Montserrat


Liberal Studies Senior

I think it’s a great idea because there are a lot of great teachers out there with a lot to offer. There are a lot of great teachers out there. If recommendations were let out, you could take their class without having to worry what kind of professor you’re going to get.
It’s a great idea because overall, it would keep education at a higher level. Better teachers would be recognized for their abilities and would get fuller classes. Students have to take the teachers so they should be able to see all the opinions of the teacher.

ABOUT THE ISSUE
Teacher Evaluations
At the present time, compiled student evaluations of Cal Poly faculty are not made available to the student body.
All faculty members are required to be evaluated periodically. Non-tenured faculty are evaluated more often and the evaluations can have an effect on their permanence at Cal Poly.
The eSU system allow schools to choose evaluation styles Individually.
Many faculty feel that evaluations are only for the guidance of the Instructor.
Several years ago, Associated Students Inc. brought the idea of a student evaluation team to the faculty. The evaluations would have been available to all students in the library. The idea was rejected.

Doctors told them it was hopeless. They refused to give up. Now they're
Making miracles
By
Carolyn Nielsen
When she was seven months old, she was bitten by a mosquito and infected with encephalitis.
She went from being a healthy bouncing newborn to a patient in a Los Angeles hospital — blind, deaf and paralyzed. She showed no response to stimuli, not even sunlight shining in her eyes.
Doctors told her mother she would always be this way. They said she should be put in an institution.
Jean Blackburn was not ready to give up.
Today, with the help of a devoted mother and dedicated volunteers, 7-year-old Katherine Blackburn can see, hear and read at a third-grade level. Her motor skills are improving every day.
Her progress is the result of a controversial form of home therapy called “patterning.”
“She’s come so far,” Jean said.
Katherine’s first form of patterning gave her sight and hearing back. “We put her in a dark closet on top of a box with a Plexiglas top. There were 1,000 watts of light and basketball-type horns. They went on and off every two seconds. We had to wear earplugs. We did it 15,000 times, 25 times a day for eight months.
“I remember one night I was sitting on the futon with Katherine in my arms thinking ‘I can’t go on. I can’t do this anymore.’ I turned on a flashlight to find something, and she squinted. It was her first facial expression. I said, ‘Oh God, its working.’ ”
Patterning is a form of therapy in which continuous stimulation provides the opportunity for the healthy parts of the brain to take over for the injured portions. The stimulation breaks through the neurological blocks.
Patterning, however, is not recognized as a valid form of therapy by the American Medical Association. “I patently disagree,” Jean said.
Skeptics say that a patterned child’s success is not due to the treatment, but is something that would have eventually happened regardless, she said.
“It may not work for everybody. Children that should be patterned need to have parents that are willing to do it,” she said.
Jean says she is frustrated because she receives no money from the state for Katherine’s therapy. If she had put Katherine in an institution, the state would have to pay for it, she said.
In countries like Italy and Norway, Jean said, the state subsidizes patterning by paying for a tutor and live-in help.
“I’ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain. It’s hard enough to just get through everyday life with a hurt kid, but I’ve got to give her a better life,” Jean said.
Once the connections start happening, they come fast, Jean

said. “Once they get rolling, they don’t stop,” she added.
The program Katherine is on was developed by internationally known physician Glen Doman, founder of the Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential in Philadelphia.
“He takes the most hurt kids that others turn away. He takes the kids nobody will give any hope to,” Jean said.
Jean said the bottom line of the program is to re-create the experiences of a well child. Most of Katherine’s current patterning is aimed at teaching her how to crawl.
For this, three volunteers work her arms and legs and turn her head to simulate crawling movements.
Jean needs three volunteers.
eight times a day, seven days a week to pattern Katherine. She said that is why she moved from Los Angeles to San Luis Obispo four years ago. “I moved here because of the community support,” she said.
Jean has about nine volunteers that are Cal Poly students. “The student volunteers I have now have been with me a long time. They spend hours in here in spite of what else they may be doing. It’s a shame they can’t get class credit for it, but it’s a credi"; to them as human beings.”
Bob George, a computer science senior, said, “I didn’t dj this for any class. I can help and learn at the same time. What could be better?” he said. “It’s the best form of therapy during finals week — just to spend time
with Katherine and Jean away from school.”
George carries a full load at Cal Poly, works two jobs and spends eight hours a week with Katherine.
“It’s hard to find anyone more in need of help or any child more injured,” he said.
George said that when he first met Katherine, she didn’t seem like a 4-year-old because she didn’t communicate her feelings.
“But now she seems like a 7-year-old because she’s really strong-willed,” he said.
Last January, Jean approached all of Cal Poly’s department heads with an informational packet about Katherine’s patterning and a proposal that they give class credit for lab hours doing her therapy.

HANS HESS/Mustang Daily
Patterning therapy for Katherine Blackburn requires three voiunteers, eight times a day, seven days a week. This exercise aims to simulate for Katherine the typical movements of a “well" child.
“The only person who even called me back was the (former) computer science department head,” she said.
Physical education professor Bob Meyers offered lab credit for working with Katherine last year. He called the patterning an excellent opportunity for students.
“It’s much more than hands-on physical therapy. It teaches
“I admire her so much just for what she’s been through and how hard she tries. It’s a lot harder than anything we can liken it to.”

HANS HESS/Mustang Daily
Jean Blackburn says she has no regrets about devoting her life to Katherine’s therapy. If someone you love gets hurt, she says, “you’re going to help them. \bu can’t just hand them over."
you to understand the gift of giving. It’s something that touches your life. It’s something you will never forget as long as you live. They (students) were profoundly impressed by the love and dedication of the mother. They could see the heart and initiative the child showed in her limited way,” he said.
Ann Morgan is in charge of setting up internships for human development majors. She said that working with Katherine is not appropriate as an internship because her students don’t have enough of a physiological background.
She said the work could be done as a senior project with the proper research.
Tim Cardana, an ornamental horticulture senior, has been working with Katherine for almost a year. “Most of the volunteers are in majors that have nothing to do with this (therapy). It seems ridiculous that they (physical education and human development majors) are not involved. I’m disappointed.”
Cardana said he found out about Katherine when he went into the Placement Center to look for a job. However, after watching the video about her, he said he just wanted to be a part of it so much that he volunteered his time.
“When she laughs, that makes it all worthwhile for me. Her spirit is really great,” he said.
James Long, an electrical engineering senior, said he feels students have a lot to gain from working with Katherine. “Here you’re working with a child, and you can almost see different parts of the brain working,” he said.
Rebecca Owen, an English junior, has been volunteering — making educational materials and patterning with Katherine — for over a year.
Owen prints up the books that Jean writes and illustrates. She said that with just one idea, she can make up to 20 books on one topic. She brought out a book about clothing and explained that Katherine receives aix)ut 20 “bits” of information per book. Rebecca also makes individual “bits” that consist of an 11-by-ll-inch flash card with a See KATHERINE, page 6

active for more than 20 years. In the past, the committee has hosted art exhibits and invited poets, coffee house musicians, storytellers and theater groups to campus. The purpose of the committee is to bring artists and musicians of all kinds to perform for students at Cal Poly.
The experience gives students an opportunity to interact with professionals and improve the social life on campus. Committee members negotiate contracts with agents over the phone which gives them a chance to fine tune their communication skills and business strategy. The committee is made up of student volunteers who choose events that they think will enhance the creative and diverse entertainment that is part of a university campus.
The committee is a bridge to the necessary resources needed to assist anyone interested in successfully bringing fine art events to Cal Poly. For more information, leave your name and number at 756-1112.

Wfe’re looking for people who look at this glass and say:
‘‘There’s gotta be other glasses of water.”
We need people capable of going beyond half-full or half-empty thinking. People who see subtleties. Who are quite frankly bored by easy answers and off-the-shelf solutions.
People who are constantly challenging their own thinking and are thirsty for new ideas and knowledge.
You’ll have a degree from a top school. Getting a job won't really be an issue. The question is: which job? Which industry?
You don’t want to get locked into one area and then discover three to five years from now that you don’t like it. By then you’ve invested too much.

RIDING
From page 1
ing plus an understanding of thr time and financial commitment required when owning a horse.
Along with the lab fee, stu dents are required to have :i riding helmet and their own health insurance. Having youi own tack (a saddle and riding pads) is recommended because the ones the horses come with aren’t in the best condition, Armstrong said.
The horses come from Ken nedy Meadows Pack Station near Lake Isabella in Southern California.
Through classes at Cal Poly the horses are fed, vaccinated and exercised. The costs are greatly minimized by having students perform many of these tasks.
Armstrong said everyone benefits from the arrangement — Kennedy Meadows, the horses and the students in the riding class and in animal science classes.
“This class is not just for beginners. There are different horses with different temper-ments and different people with different temperments too, and it’s good experience learning how to work with all kinds,” Armstrong said.
Safety, the top priority
Horses and riders are matched up for two weeks according to skill. Then the riders are switched to give experience handling different horses.
Armstrong said there have not been any serious accidents because the safety aspect of the class is strictly enforced. Before anyone gets on a horse, the Cal Poly fire department speaks to the class about safety.
Armstrong emphasized that safety working with horses is a must. Concerns about safety among other animal science instructors is high. Students who work with livestock and especially horses must keep in mind that being safe and being informed is important, he said.
Armstrong said this class is for everyone and anyone who wishes to work with horses any time in their life either for pleasure or for a career.
Reasons for popularity
Horseback riding is the number-one pleasure industry, both in numbers of pteople involved and in number of dollars, Armstrong said. Riding horses gives a sense of therapy, both physical and mental, said Armstrong.
Students take this class for a number of different reasons, he said.
Some take it because they want to work in the horse industry, others for the horse experience or just for the pleasure of working with horses.
“I’ve always been interested in horses. This is my last quarter here at Cal Poly, and I wanted to able to enjoy this class while I can,” said John Scott, a civil engineering senior.
Armstrong said, “You have to be honest with horses. They deserve your resptect. They’re sensitive, gentle and kind. If you think you’re pretty tough, a horse will make you think about that one more time.”
As an instructor, Armstrong says the greatest feeling of satisfaction comes from seeing a student develop a love for horses.
“It appears like something deep inside of them was moved when it happens.”
