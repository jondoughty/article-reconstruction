Plans for DOwer and leat plant underway
By Ron Nieben
suit WtIWr
The future of a three-year-old plan to construct a co-generation facility at Cal Poly will be decided in the next several months, the executive dean said Friday.
Douglas Gerard said that the Allied Signal Corporation of Connecticut is evaluating final legal technicalities and the tax advantages of constructing the plant before making its final proposal. The privately owned and built plant will provide steam for campus heating and cooling as well as generate profit for Cal Poly and the state from the sale of electricity.
“It is now to the point that within the next three months we will know if it’s a go or no-go situation," Gerard said. While the profits from the sale of an estimated 28 megawatts of electricity each year is still an attractive incentive to Allied Signal Corporation, changes in the tax laws proposed by the Reagan Administration may drastically lower returns from the $30 million plant.
Co-generation was first developed in the late 1800s and uses waste heat from the production of steam to turn a turbine and produce electricity. With the availability of cheap energy beginning in the 1950s, co-generation fell out of favor. By 1977, only four percent of energy for industry was cogenerated compared with nearly 50 percent at the turn of the century.
High energy prices in the last two decades have prompted large energy users such as universities, hospitals and factories to reinvestigate co-generation as a cost-saving strategy. A well-designed system, Gerard said, will produ« more than 1.60 times more usable energy from See PLANT, hack page

US concedes Iranian actions may be legal
WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States acknowledged Monday that Iran may have acted within traditional naval warfare	rules	in	stopping	and
searching an American merchant ship near the Persian Gulf to determine if it was carrying arms for Iraq.
A final judgment on how to respond	to	the	incident	was
withheld	until	the	American	ambassador	to	the	United Arab
Emirates completes his questioning of the capuin of the President Taylor, and other facu are assessed. State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb said.
Kalb’s sutement seemed to
represent an effort by the Reagan administration to avoid a flareup with the fundamentalism Moslem regime in Tehran, which is listed by the department as a supporter of terrorism.
Asked what the United States intended to do about the incident, Kalb said “we are evaluating our option." He declined to elaborate.
However, the spokesman did say in a statement that a belligerent nation traditionally has "certain rights” under the rules of naval warfare, to find out whether neutral shipping is being used to provide contraband to its
enemy.
Meanwhile, G. Quincy Lumb-sden Jr., the U.S. ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, was sent to Fujaira to meet with the freighter’s captain, Robert Reimann.
In a precautionary move, two American combat ships — the destroyer Conolly and the frigate Boone — had been moved to the Gulf of Oman, where seven armed Iranian sailors halted and then boarded the President Taylor on Sunday.
The ships were there “to prevent anything other than what happened," Defense Secretary
Caspar W. Weinberger told reporters at a breakfast meeting at the Pentagon. “The boarders left very quietly after an hour, an hour-and-a-half. There wasn’t any need for the kind of naval protection that the ship was seeking.”
The Conolly and the Boone were near the Persian Gulf, but too far north to prevent the boarding, and yet “they were close enough that they could have prevented the Iranians from taking that ship under tow or forcing it to an Iranian port,” said a Navy source, insisting on anonymity.

Cal Poly
Research is alive and well
By Kathi Peoples
Special to the DaNy
Innovations through research are usually not associated with non-land grant universities such as Cal Poly, but there is a variety of ongoing research and development on campus.
Land grant universities were set up in the late 19th century by President Abraham Lincoln with the primary purpose of doing research, said Ed Carnegie of the Cal Poly agricultural engineering department.	, , , .

Should Foundation divest from companies doing business in S. Africa?!
Nkk Aihanasakos, sanlor, ia-dustrial engincciiag:
I'm for it. I don’t agree with South Afnai's policy and the only way we can put pressure on them is through economic sanctions because we’re obviously not going to war against them.
LEnERS
Keith SimoB, teoior, cb< virooBiealal eagiBcciiag, tcBalor from the School of EaglBcciiBg:
It's a complicated question. I’m torn. On one hand 1 feel we shouldn't divest because if you hold stock in a company, you can influence it ... on the other hand you divest to make a sutemcnt that you don't like the politics of the country.

FItaroy Raphael, senior, OMchaBlzed agrlcBlturc:
They should divest for humanitarian reasons and I can’t think of anything more humanitarian than divesting. They (U.S.) do military intervention for lesser problems than apartheid ... look at Grenada ... though I don’t think violence is the answer.




K •^rrij hi
Anne Green, Junior, child development:
I'm opposed to divestment. I feel if we stop supporting businesses completely, then in the long run, it will hurt blacks working in the area more than whites.
MOtc Mendcs, ASI Presidrni:
I favor partial divestmem I feel I that the Foundation ¡>hould divest in all companies noi ad hering to the Sullivan Principles. The principles are guidelines | which provide an environment for the employer to make a positive contribution toward the fight against apartheid.
Sexual harassment can take many forms
Editor — Regarding the Jan. 10 article on aexual hareasment at Cal Poly — Whan moat people think about sexual harassment, they probably envision some guy pawing at a girl or a group of "good ol' boys" shouting rude comments at a vary shocked and distraught young lady.
A not-soconsldarad type of harassment Is hetarosax-ual-homoaaxual conflicts. Many people sea no harm In calling someone a "faggot" or a "dyke," but the harsh reality Is that thia conatitutea a form of sexual harassment. It la also i)ot proper for gays to call haterosaxuala things Ilka "braadars," ate.
This type ol torment causes many gays and lasbiana to restrain their natural feelings. This causes stress which leads to anything from impaired academic performance to substance abuse to sulclda.
1 applaud the university In Its decision to maintain a sexual harassment policy. I only hope that It Includes harassment's many forms and that the administration enforces the policy heavy-handedly SCOTT R MILLER Gay and Lesbian Student Union

Tell me, why'did the ad man jump out the window?
Note: This inter-office memo was found clutched in (he hand of the president of A. Varice Ad Agency. He jumped from the company’s tenth story window on New Year’s Eve. The coroner believes the memo is a suicide note — of sorts.
Dear Dan;
We’d best get Research and Development moving full throttle. America’s back, America’s strong, America's ready for computer-generated advertisements and fantabulous new products. And here’s some ideas to help our company capture America’s heart and bank accounts;
OK, so someone’s beat us to dog food containing breath fresheners. So what?! We’ll dazzle ’em with doggie deodorants and canine cologne. People love their pets, and they’ve got millions to spend on them now that giving money to famine victims is out of style.
What about celebritiea, Dan, the new American hero? I- Kids are dancin' in the streets all night long, hoisting Pepai caiu in worship to Lionel Richie. It’s a new generation cornin’ at ya, God yes I Picture Springsteen label sincere jeans made by laid-off
sends his camera to the Grand Canyon on motorized tripod, it takes pictures better than Ansel Adams, while Joe guzzles the king of beers at home on the couch. Let’s design gadgets that do everything for the American consumer.
Kids are dancin* in the streets all night long, hoisting Pepsi cans in worship to Lionel Richie.
steelworkers ^ folks will stand in line for hours to spend a hundred bucks apiece for them. Let’s reach for the stars. Dan, they all have their price, and America loves ’em all.
Gadgets, Dan, gadgets are America’s specialty. How about cameras that load, wind, focus, compose, shoot, develop, and make enlargements all by themselves?! Joe Consumer
But I haven’t forgotten the marketer’s dream- holy health and hygiene! Let’s exploit everyone’s fears about their bodies. Girls hate guys who sweat, and vice versa. Our medical crew could create a pill (hat plugs the pores so they’ll never sweat again! Pills, I love the darlings, they’re an ad man’s dream babies. Pills to stop congestion, sore throat, runny nose.
insomnia, hemorrhoids, fever, ihc heartbreak of psoriasis, nagging backache, unwanted pregnanoes. and fear of nuclear war Huey Lewis can spread (he news: "\ke made a new drug, one that cures everything. Gets rid of tears and fears, it even uught me to sing "
And now that we’ve made them all superhuman, Dan. we can keep them occupied wtPr toys and more toys. Cars that drive best at twice the speed limit, with dual turbos and quick conversion to all-terrain vehicle for easy destruction of wilderness areas. At night, pop on the camper top and hook up the Amana radar range «.ause it’s Miller time.
Yes, Dan, as our beloved President said when he returned from Geneva, freedom is ibe byword that spurs us on. \^cre free to make as much monev us we can. Let’s go for it like loial ly, all the way. May the spun ot Rambo be with us.

US still working to return MIAs
WASHINGTON (AP) — A top Pentagon official, condemning private attempts to locate missing American servicemen in Indochina, said Monday the United Stata Is making progress with iu campaign to determine what happened to the 1,797 Amerkarastifl^nissing in Vietnam.	—
Richard L. Armitage, the assistant defense secretary for international murity affairs, told reporters that the Pentagon has 93 “live^ighting repohs** of Americans on file that it cannot dismiss as fabrications.
But he added that the Vietnamese government,' in negotiations concluded last week, has pledged to investigate those reports. The Vietnamese also have begun investigating reports from their own people invoiving the status of missing Americans, and they arc allowing joint U^S.-Vietnamese teams to conduct “multiple” excavations at sites where American planes are known.to have crashed during the war. he said.
Divestment up for vote in SF
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An ordinanee forcing San Francisco to divest South African investments faced a city supervisors' vote Monday amid a battle over an amendment that would weaken the measure.
The ordinance would prohibit the city from contracting with or investing money in businesses that have ties to South Africa to protest that nation’s policy of enforced segregation, called apsutheid.	___________1....................—
A controversial amendment that also would prohibit the city from buying goods produced by companies with ties to South Africa was adopted on a 6-3 vote two weeks ago.

Seatbelt laws violate rights of individualis
ROCKFORD, Mich. (AP) —-There’s a town in Michigan where not wearing seat belts is a crime without penahy. •
Judge Stephen R. Servaas admitted he suspended the fines of 23 to 30 people ticketed for not wearing seat beiu. Michigan law has required seat belt use since July I, but Servaas said that infringes on individual righu.
”I can’t imagine what he’s got on his mind.” said resident Mike Cooper. ”1 think he’s out of line.” Servaas hasn’t heard such criticism since he requested bullet-proof panels in his courtroom and a cache for a pistol.

It has been operating for sevep years and has proven to be one of the most economical designs known for a solar dehydrator^ It has a much shorter pay-off period than other government-funded ’ projects, Carnegie said. ..
“A lot of OUT projects start off aa student projecu," Carnegie .said. ^'I like to bring real-life problems into the classroom' and have my students work on solutions.”
One of Carnegie’s^ best project memories began when the direc-tor of research for the California Almond Advisory Board called 'him looking for a way to get rid of bio-mass in almond orchards left after the aop has been pruned.
The board was concerned with not being able to bum waste products in the future, said Carnegie. ”1 invited him to talk to my design class about the problem. He wasn’t Very optimistic, but agreed to com and talk to the class.
"They presented their infor-

The' clan guest seemed, unim-"^ pressed'at first. ”but pretty soon he was sitting on the edge of his chair,” Carnegie said.	(
The research director said he got more information in four weeks from the students than he had ^in several months from a consuhing firm he paid $30,000, , according to Carnegie.
The concept was further developed and resulted in a USDA grant to build a prototype' solid waste compactor designed spedficaly for the California almond grower. It is currently being built on campus by students, said Carnegie.

Mustangs home after roadtrip, 1-1
Superbowl: Why bother with it?
By The Aaaodatad Proa
It's starting out aa the Why Bother Super Bowl. As in, why bother to play it when the National Football League can just declare the Chicago Bears the champion?
No sooner had the New England Patriots followed Chicago's 244) shutout of the Los Angeles Rams by upsetting the> Miami Dolphins 31-14 Sunday than the predictions about the Jan. 26 title game in New Orleans started rolling in.
Sixteen-three Bears, “in a very boring game,“ predicted a Miami television anal^. Twenty-four-seven Bears predicted a respected national football
writer.
That may be a bit premature, particularly since for only the third time in 20 ‘ years, both teams are playing in their First Super Bowls, a disorienting experience for a lot of players.
The Bears, 13-1 in the regular season, have long since been anointed as the National Foot-bidl League’s best team. They solidified that position by becoming the Fust team ever to register two straight shutouu in the playoffs — 21-0 over the New York Giants, then Sunday's whitewash of the Rams.
But while everyone’s been eyeing the Bears, the Patriou have
quietly snuck up on people, winning 12 of their last 14, including three road victories in the playoffs.
Their only losses in the last three months were by 16-13 to the New York Jett in overtime and 30-27 in Miami, losses they avenged in the playoffs.
They beat the Raiders at the Los Angeles Colisetim a week ago, then eitded an eight-game Miami winning streak and their own 18-game losing streak at the Orange Bowl — giving them quality road victories over quality teams in games in which their season was on the line.

The Cal Poly women’s basketball team broke even in iu first pair of league games over the weekend.
The Lady Mustangs played in a warm University of Califoniia Riverside gym Thursday, but could only connect on a cold 23 of 70 shots from the floor for a 32 percent average.
“We only lost by* seven, but they (Riverside) beat us worse than the score showed,” said assistant coach Jill Orrock. “There was a lack of intensity and drive — we went out flat.’’
The score at halftime set Riverside ahead 31-23. The Highlanders maintained their lead by outrebounding the Mustangs 31-40 and hitting 27 of 37 from the Field for a 47 percent average from the field.
The Lady Mustangs trailed most of the game and didn’t pull to within seven until the last two and a half minutes of the game.
“We Finally started to play some basketball in the last two and a half minutes,” Orrock said. Nonetheleu, it was too little too late. The Musungs lost 63-31.
Barb Blackburn, a 6’2" senior out of De Anza Junior College, hit nine of 21 shots for a game high 21 points. Teammate Janet Jorgensen poured in 14 points to go seven for 18 on the night.
In another league match-up Saturday, Poly showed more in-
tensity as it beat the Toros of Cal Sute Dominguez Hills- at their own game.
The Toros, known for their agreuive play, lost to an equally agressive Cal Poly squad 63-39.
“The Toros are very tenacious.” Orrock said. “But we were pretty tenacious ourselves. We made things happen and got to the (foul) line a lot.’’
The Mustangs showed a lot of hustle and determination, making 41 percent of their shou for the game and 47 percent in the second half. The second win “renewed our faith,” Orrock said.
^.Trish Oroo led the Musung attisek against the Toros scoring 16 poinu, while BUckbum continued her hot streak with 14 poinu. Jorgensen also checked in with a well-balanced effort of 12 poinu and nine boards.
The Lady Musungs ended up the weekend with a 9-3 overall record and 1-1 in league play.
The Musungs are awaiting the | challenge of the Maudors of California Suue University Nor-thridge. The Maudors will arrive in San Luis Obispo Thursday for a 7:30 p.m. match-up in Cal Poly’s Main Gym. The Matadors are 11-2 on the season and 1-0 in
league play.
*
The Lady Musungs will host California Sute University Los Angeles Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in the Main Gym. Cal Sute L.A. is 4-7 on the season and O-I in league play.

American music: a hit in Mexico
MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) — A crowd of young musk fans at the phish video bar, Heaven, watches Bruce Springsteen stmt his stuff with the hit song, "Bom intheU.S.A.”
' Formally attired waiters serve ^drinks as Madonna, Phil Collins, Sade, Rod Stewart, Santana, Stevie Wonder and the Eurythmics follow Springsteen on a video screen. It's nonstop rock. The crowd loves it, but not everyone understands the lyrics.
' American music is popular throughout Mexico, and is even more so in Monterrey, a 214-hour drive from, the Texas border at Laredo.
Monterrey music buffs can view three musk video programs
a day that offer the latest American and British releases. Those with satellite antennas in the wealthy suburbs get nonstop MTV. Radio listeners have an assortment of English-language roek and record stares are ftill of the inpst popular releases.
"We’re very close to the United Sutes so the influence is in-evitabk," said Edgardo Resen-diz, a local television cuhural commenutor. "These influenees are giving us a new musk culture. We have to learn to live within this cultural mix.
Yet, the bombardment of American musk, which began in the 1960s, has not eclipsed the popularity of most styles of musk from Mexico and otho
countries.
Sergeant Peppers, a Monterrey discotheque, and dozens of other discos in cities near the U.S. border offer something for every musk lover. Dtec Jockeys spin lively "salsa" or "cumbia" melt^ies and patrons switch easily from rock to the Latin dances they learned as children.
The popular national TV program, "Siempre cn Domingo," features Latin entertainers singing Uve on Sundays for 4)4 hours.
Mexicans were listening to the Spanish romantk singer Julio Iglesias long before duets with WilUe Nelson and Diana Rou helped launch his career in the United Slates.

each unit of gas than a conventional system.
Sevend companies have made proposals for the plant in the last three years, but the recent recession and the volatik natural gas and oil price situation have in-crestsed the ' risk of building alternative energy facilities that require large capital outlays. The state decided not to flnance the plant itself, Gerard said, because it would tie up too much of the sute’s resources. With a private firm, the state invests only land.
The builder will own and operate the facility and sell steam to the university and power to PO R E. Part of the income from electricity sales and the profits from the lease of land to the bulkier will be split between the state and the university to be used for energy related projects.
"The advantage to the university is primarily an aconomk one." Ocirard said. An estimated $5 miUioo will be generated over the first five yesus of operation. The university, which uses approximately five megawatts of clectrkity each year, will continue to buy power directly from PO R E and will purchase steam fropi the new faidlity.
Under the current proposal, steam from the natural gas fueled plant would be piped nearly two miles to the current steam plant across from the Health
Center, The 4,000 pounds of steam produced each hour would then enter the 36,000 feet of underground pipe that heat and cool the major buildings on cam-pus._
The distance from the plant to the campus core required a. redesigning of the delivery pipe to increase the efficiency of the system. "There are some losses associated with the distance." Gerard said, "but it is not a

The present steam plam. whkh is showing signs of old age, has nof been maintained in top condition in antidpation of the new facility being built. Chief engineer for Cal Poly, Robert Pahlow,, said that rust is starting to detwriorata some pumps and tanks ahhough “then is probably a lot of good yean kfl in the boilers."
If a CO gensratioa facility is' buflt, the machinery and welding programs would be rdooated in the old steam plant.
