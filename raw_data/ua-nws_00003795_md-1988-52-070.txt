Beginners and experts got together Saturday at the annual Adventure Day to participate in three military-type exercises. The day of events, sponsored by the military science department, included a beginning rappelling course, an orienteering competition and a biathalon (a two-mile run combined with a marksmanship tournament). Rich Steel, officer in charge of Adventure Day, said, “Our mission today is to
train our cadets, recruit new cadets and create an Interface with the rest of campus and the public ... to maintain good relations with everyone and have fun in military kinds of events, also related to civilians.”
The rappelling took place down the tower of the Architecture and Environmental Design Building«
Senate discusses fund-raiser tax
By Alison Skratt
Staff Writer
Organizations holding charity fund-raisers in the University Union will always have to pay a surcharge to ASI if a senator’s bill passes through the Student Senate.
Senator Andy Herrick’s Bill 88-02 requires a 10 percent charge for all such organizations.
As the rule stands now, according to Resolution 86-28, organizations holding charity fund-raisers in the U.U. can defer the surcharge — 10 percent of their total profit — if they petition the senate and the senate approves.
The 10 percent charged to all fund-raisers is put into the Campus Improvement Fund and is the only source of income for it and the student planning commission. The commission reviews and donates money to student and faculty projects that beautify the campus.
Apparently, more and m.ore organizations who have charity fund-raisers have been petitioning to have the surcharge waived, draining the commission’s resources.
This issue was raised because last week Lambda Chi Alpha petitioned to get back the $400 surcharge it paid for its Thrash-a-Thon. The senate approved the
request, reducing the commission’s account to $2,000.
Herrick doesn’t agree with waiving the surcharge. But he has nothing against charities.
“I think the student planning commission was overlooked in Resolution 86-28,” said Herrick, chairman of the commission.
“Approximately 75 percent of all fund-raisers (held in the U.U.) are charitable,” he said. And if they all asked for their surcharge back, he said, the commission’s resources would be depleted.
School of Engineering Senator Kyle Shepard, also on the commission, agrees with Herrick.
“It’s vital for the bill to pass in order for the commission to continue at Cal Poly,” Shepard said. “Without the bill, we won’t have a funding source.”
Herrick said another problem with Resolution 86-28 is it left the word “charitable” completely open to interpretation. This required the senate to interpret each petition, he said, and that takes a lot of the senate’s time.
His bill would define the word as “a group or organization outside Cal Poly and ASI that’s non-profit and recognized (by the list of official charities in the Student Life and Activities office) to be serving their benefactor directly.”
Bill 88-02 would put a $200 maximum limit to be paid per See CHARITY, page 4
Police detect stolen parking permits daily
Berrett says finding stolen permits easy because cars are recognizable
By Lawrence Anton
staff Writer
Stealing a parking permit or buying one from “some guy” may seem an innocuous crime and an easy way to beat the Cal Poly parking blues, but there’s a good chance of getting caught, said Detective Ray Berrett of the Cal Poly police department.
The recovery last week of two
stolen permits by campus police buttresses Berrett’s remark. One student was cited for possessing stolen property and released, and the other case is still being investigated for mitigating circumstances.
Parking Officer Cindy Campbell said recovering two or three permits a week is not unusual. As many as six have been recovered in a single day.

Top business professionals to attend conference
By Jill Gregory
staff Writer
Cal Poly students and faculty interested in interacting with top professionals from business and industry will be able to do so by attending a business seminar this week.
“American Industry Meets the Challenge” is the theme of the 22nd annual Society for the Advancement of Management Business Seminar to be held today and tomorrow. The seminar will feature executive and corporate leaders speaking to groups on campus.
During the two-day seminar, business
professionals from such companies as Lockheed, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Price Waterhouse and Bank of America will participate in various panel discussions and address individual classes.
The keynote speaker of the seminar will be former U.S. Representative Victor A. Veysey, now director emeritus of the Industrial Relations Center at the California Institute of Technology. Veysey received his master’s of business administration from Harvard University.
Student organizers of the seminar describe it as an opportunity for students and faculty to learn from experienced professionals in different fields.
“We are very excited about the seminar,” said Pam de la Pena, seminar chairperson. “We have a good mix of people from established corporations as well as many entrepreneurs.”
The Cal Poly chapter of SAM is a club designed to prepare students for top management positions in ail fields. Areas emphasized by club activities are managerial skills, goal setting, planning and time management.
The seminar is usually a success due to the caliber of professionals who attend, said de la Pena. Cal Poly alumni are cooperative in helping to attract guests and the national SAM organization helps
out as well, she said.
“This year is good because we have two women speakers coming,” said de la Pena. “It is usually very difficult to get women.

Playground politics
Dirty politics. Once again we must deal with the disgrace of politicians who resort to personal attacks to fight their political battles.
An example is the latest round of verbal fisticuffs between candidates George Bush and Robert Dole. Both Republicans, their personal attacks achieve only the destruction of respect for themselves and their political party in the public eye. Sure, politics is a stressful business in which success is difficult to gauge most of the time. A little victory in the headlines after an insulting exchange may give a feeling of success and reward.
This unfortunate aspect of politics only proves that the current batch of individuals is so inept at political understanding that they cannot hold logical debate on the issues. Instead, to liven up the action for television, they attempt to degrade each other like kids on the playground.
A case can be made that these attacks actually give insight to the true political animal that the public may never see. But political decisions must be based on hard facts, not the vengeful tactics of a candidate with a bad attitude.
Is it also a reflection of the public’s apathy? Maybe the candidates would rather issue personal attacks because they know the public really doesn’t care or know anything about the issues. A public trained on soap operas is quickly bored to tears by politics. Why not liven things up and take a lesson from the soaps by attacking character flaws? It sure makes headlines and it sure gets people talking.
At its roots this childlike insult trading destroys the political process. It diverts attention from the issues and trivializes the world’s most important political event.

Black death creeps north
Editor:
I am writing about the recent approval by the County Board of Supervisors for on- and offshore oil manufacturing. I am a primary source, that is, I speak from my own first-hand experience with oil drilling off and on the coast of Santa Barbara and Ventura. These oil companies have been, and remain to be, notorious for misleading the public and downright lying to them. I lived in Santa Barbara and Goleta for nearly 16 years. I moved to San Luis Obispo permanently one year ago. I am a tar refugee.
When I first moved to Santa Barbara in 1971, the beaches were surrounded by beautiful white cliffs and rocks. You could swim in the water and the tar was hardly noticeable — just small flecks here and there.
Then we had an oil slick (my first of several), in which many types of marine life were sacrificed. Volunteers cleaned it off the beaches, not the oil company, who was at fault. They did not even clean it out of the water this first time!
Of course, the oil company managed to keep that quiet and at a later date, claimed they had participated in the slick cleanup. But that is not true. I was there. Volunteers had to try and wash off birds and baby seals that were paralyzed by the oil and tar. Still the majority died.
Does anyone care? It does not seem so in Santa Barbara, where money talks and values walk. Did you know that the United States only produces 2 percent of the oil it consumes?
Nowadays in the Santa Barbara and Ventura area you cannot walk along the beach without wearing your “tar” shoes or “beach” shoes because you will
\\
/

get a new sole on them every time (made of tar). There are very few rocks and cliffs along the beach that remain white — most are black with tar coating. Almost every bathing suit and pair of shorts I own have tar/oil stains because you cannot avoid it there. 1 have been trying to escape it, but now they want to start here. Before you know it, there will be no clean coastline left.
I watched the oil/tar problem progressively and steadily increase in the water, and on the beaches, in direct proportion with the increase in oil platforms built.
Basically, it comes down to oil company money. As we have seen over the past decade plus, a good part of government is corrupt. And the root of the corruption, most often, is money. So these two go together, hand in hand, each feeding the other.
Did you know that the government very suddenly attempted to disban the Coastal Commission? It is one of the only public check systems we have in our favor against the oil companies ruining our coast. Remember when two tankers collided at Point Conception a few months ago? It took three days before it was admitted that one carried oil and there was no mention of the condition of marine life that was involved.
Just because we use a resource does not mean we need to abuse it. This attitude of taking all you can get without regard for your future and your childrens’ futures really scares me today. I look forward to our generation moving forward and showing the country we can find other ways to make petrol or petrol substitutes. We can eliminate greed and bring forth caring, concern and respect for our planet and its limited resources. Take an active step and vote if you can.
— Pat McQuillen
What a trip
Editor:
I am outraged and 1 want something done!
Upon calling Gulliver’s Travel in the U.U. to check on my spring break reservations to Mexico, I found that my flight, which I booked four months in advance, is no longer $221 but $310.
•A 40 percent increase.
•I was not told that my flight was not guaranteed.
•I was not told to pay in advance to guarantee my price.
•And, I found that the price quoted to me is not even good for flights booked for spring break!
Now what? A student plans a vacation four months in advance and it is shot to pieces by the incompetence of the travel agency. I would think that since Gulliver’s Travel is part of the campus that they would be informative, knowledgable and work for the student benefit! I consider this extremely bad business. It baffles me that they are allowed to conduct this kind of poor customer service.

Thinkable art
Editor:
I would like to praise the Mustang Daily for its openness to preseat all sides of an issue. The position of the Daily is to inform and stimulate its readers to think. The abortion cartoon last week was one such occasion.
On Friday Ms. Trumbull wrote a letter blasting the Daily for printing the cartoon. She missed the very object of the cartoon, which is to stimulate thought.
Just because of an unplanned pregnancy you don’t need to forego your goals. Many pregnant mothers and mothers with children attend Poly. To someone irresponsible enough to have sex unprotected, raising a child must seem an insurmountable task. The loss of a child by adoption is a hardship many mothers have to deal with. But 1 think it’s comforting to know your child is being cared for by someone who loves and wants it. The thought of your child lying dead in a garbage can behind some doctor’s office has little comfort. The way you lose a child says a lot about how you feel about the loss.
Think about the opposing view. What about a child’s right to control its body? If you don’t agree, at least the cartoon caused you to think about it.
— Kenneth A. Hitt
Poetry fit for a president
Editor:
Our Baker Who art on campus (once in a while)
Hallowed be thy name (at least to your subordinates and the ignorant in the Student Senate)
Thy kingdom is here (but where are you?)
Thy will be done
(if not rightfully, forcefully)
On campus
As well as in Washington, D.C. (where is your heart, Mr. President?)
Take from us our daily bread (and give it to the jocks)
And forgive us our bitching (because the blissfully ignorant model students do not bitch)
As we forgive the jocks (who bitch about lack of support)
In the name of President Baker His Id, and his Superego AMEN
Postscript: Mr. President, do you dream that someday they will name a great, big building on campus after you? Maybe it will be a huge 2,(X)0-man sauna for all the jocks that will be enrolled at Cal Poly. They’ll call it THE BAKERY. It’H be a monument of irony in honor of the Civil Engineer/Cal Poly President who bowed to support the jocks with a building realized through engineering techniques (knock knock, remember engineering? — once the essence of academics at Cal Poly).

Love
confession from an anthemaniac.
As you know, anthe-maniacs like myself just go crazy around flowers. So what does my Valentine send me on Valentines Day?
The FTD* Lov/e Note Bouquet!
Well, let me tell you, when I saw those beautiful flowers in that fine porcelain bowl It drove me wild.
Besides, this glorious bouquet also came with a note pad and pencil with which I’ve written my Valentine every day.
And smart Valentines know it doesn’t cost much to send us anthemaniacs Into this flower frenzy.
Just ask your florist to have n"D send one for you.
PERMITS
From page 1
Berrett said “the student who is trying to save a few bucks by stealing a parking permit or buying one from some guy in the parking lot stands to lose a lot more.”
Any car found displaying a permit that has been reported stolen will be towed at the owner’s expense. A citation for possessing stolen property will be issued to the person under whose name the car is registered. And the matter will go to the courts, where fines average $200.
But how can a parking officer spot a stolen permit amid the thousands of cars parked on campus? Easy, says Berrett.
“They recognize the cars out there,” he said. ‘‘Between themselves they can talk about cars that they’re having trouble with.”
Campbell said, “We look for distinguishing marks. Let’s say it has a Mustang Village parking permit and then it has a staff permit. We’re probably gonna wonder why ... so we’ll do some checking into that.”
It’s usually the “floater” permits, those that hang from a rearview mirror, that get stolen, Campbell said. If a stolen permit is spotted “on the bumper, there’s usually a story behind it: somebody’s reported it stolen
and given it to a friend.”
In January, more than half of the police reports filed were for stolen permits. The 21 thefts reported last month bring the total of stolen permits still outstanding to 93.
The police record resulting from a petty theft arrest can be more costly than the fines levied, Berrett said. “A record can follow you,” especially someone hoping to work one day for a company that requires a security clearance, he said.
Troubled that college students would be so petty as to steal parking permits, Berrett said “People need to look a little more toward the future.”

Other events scheduled for the seminar include an MBA panel discussion titled “Business in the 1990s: Planning for the Individual and the Corporation” and both accounting and marketing panels.
Although the seminar’s emphasis is on business, de la Pena said it could be beneficial to a variety of students. Issues will be discussed in engineering and computer science as well as other areas.

The commission’s latest project is putting an entrance sign, like the ones on Grand Avenue and Highland Drive, on the California Boulevard entrance. It

The commission is also responsible for other campus beautifications. In 1981, it gave $2,000 to build the Erhart bridge outside the Agriculture Building. In 1986, it donated more than $1,000 to build the Computer Science Building’s walkway and seating area. And in 1982, it contributed $1,000 for the yarn sculpture on the library’s second floor.

Team down to 7 players
Fouls and Riverside fail to stop Poly
By Sherry Wittmann
Staff Writer
With only seven players able to play Saturday night against U.C. Riverside, the Cal Poly basketball team knew from the start that too many fouls could destroy all hopes of victory. The Lady Mustangs’ roster dropped to seven last week after junior center Stacy Rooney was declared academically ineligible.
Yet with almost three minutes remaining in the game and Cal Poly ahead, 65-64, four out of the five Lady Mustangs on the floor had four fouls. And sophomore Russia Madden, who fouled out, was watching helplessly from the bench.
“I told them, ‘Keep your defense aggressive, but be smart,’ ” said head coach Jill Or-rock.
The advice paid off, as Cal Poly held on to win, 73-66.
With 2:46 left, sophomore guard Jody Hasselfield drew a foul and sank two free throws to

Hasselfield tacked on four more points through free throws to clinch the win. She was 14 of 16 from the line, finishing with 23 points to lead the team.
“In watching (Riverside) miss their free throws I knew how important it was to get mine,’’ she said.
The Highlanders made only 15 of 27 free throws.
The Lady Mustangs succeeded in keeping their turnovers down. They had only four, compared to a season average of 19.

DARRELL MIHO/Mustang Daily
Cal Poly’s Mitch Pierce shoots against Riverside Saturday.
As the cliche goes, the best defense is a good offense. But the Cal Poly basketball team turned that cliche around Saturday night, as it defeated U.C. Riverside, 56-49, in overtime.
Cal Poly improved its record to 6-1 in the California Collegiate Athletic Association, while the Highlanders fell to 4-3. The win was the Mustangs’ sixth in a row and they continued a nine-game winning streak at home.
MEN’S HOOPS
Cal Poly and Cal State Bakersfield, tied for the league lead, will face off Tuesday. Tipoff is 8 p.m. in the Main Gym. Bakersfield is responsible for the Mustangs’ only conference loss.
From the start of Saturday’s game Cal Poly head coach Steve Beason and assistant coach Steve Barnes screamed at their players, “Strong D, don’t let them through.’’
“The team did an excellent job on defense,’’ said Beason. “Riverside has a lot of players with strong offensive capabilities, and in order for us to win we needed to stop them.’’
Riverside features three players who consistently score in double figures. One of them, Maurice Pullum, a junior guard from Chicago, is the fifth best scorer in the C.C.A.A. with a 17.8 average. Cal Poly senior guard Jeff Gray held him to six points.
“Jeff did a great job of denying Pullum the ball,’’ said Beason. “Pullum is one of Riverside’s key offensive weapons and when you shut him down, you take a lot away from Riverside’s offense.’’
The game started slowly, with both teams playing strong defense and forcing each other to use most of the 45-second shot clock. At the end of the first half, Cal Poly led, 24-19.
The Mustangs came out cold in the second half, not scoring their See MEN, back page

A Mustang avoids a pickoff attempt Saturday.
TUSTIN ELLISON/Muetang Daily
The Cal Poly baseball team showed an impressive display of power as it swept a doubleheader from Cal State Hayward Saturday afternoon at Sinsheimer Stadium.
The Mustangs dominated both games, taking the first, 6-1, and exploding in the second, 12-5. Cal Poly improved its record to 3-2, while Hayward fell to 0-3.
In the first game, Hayward had 10 hits, but couldn’t capitalize on the opportunities as they stranded seven runners. Cal Poly designated hitter Gary Renko had two hits and one RBI, and second baseman Joe Rumsey added two hits.
Game two was one to watch under the sunny skies of a
beautiful day. The Mustangs jumped off to a quick start as Hayward starter • Steve Moen didn’t make it past the first inning.
Hayward got two quick runs on a fielding error by center-fielder Rich Sheppard in the second inning, but the Mustangs

hadn’t even started. In the bottom half of the inning Cal Poly third baseman Willie Clemens jumped on reliever Sean Sexton for a double off the leftfield wall. Sexton soon found himself in trouble as he loaded the bases twice and walked in a run. Cal Poly came away with three runs.
The third frame was no different as Cal Poly had another See BASEBALL, page 6

Barbara scored a 170.45 for second place and Southern Utah State had 161.0.
“This is the best score we have had all year,” said Cal Poly head coach Tim Rivera.
Kim Wells, the top-ranked gymnast in the Western Region, won the all-around with 35.75

points. She tied Kriss Miller of San Jose for first place on the balance beam with a 9.05. Wells tied for second in the floor exercise (9.05) and the vault (9.0). She also placed third in the uneven bars with an 8.65.
Mimi Phene, ranked 20th nationally, was fourth in the overall with 35.35. points. She won the vault with a 9.4, good for a new school record. She also tied for first in the uneven bars with a score of 8.9.
Phene did not place on the balance beam or the floor exercise. The crowd was disappointed when Phene successfully completed a double back flip in her floor routine and only received an 8.5.
Chris Kotzbach of Santa Barbara placed second in the all-around with 35.65 points, followed by Miller with 35.4. Kotzbach won the floor exercise with a 9.25 and Miller tied for first on the uneven bars and balance beam.
Kimm Zernik, a Cal Poly sophomore, injured her knee in the beginning of her floor exercise and was unable to complete the routine. Zernik is one of several Lady Mustangs to be injured this year.
Wendy Meyer said when a teammate was injured in the past, the Lady Mustangs had a tendency to give up. But they have learned how unproductive that can be.
“We’re not giving up anymore, no matter what happens,” she said.
The Lady Mustangs will travel north Friday to compete at San Jose State on Friday. They will then compete in the Chico State Jamboree Invitational on Saturday.

“That is everything,” said Or-rock. “It’s what we’ve been working on.”
Although Cal Poly appeared to be the aggressors, the Highlanders threatened to take the lead several times in the first half. However, their efforts were only marginally successful.
Riverside shot often, but couldn’t sink the shots. As a result. Cal Poly ended the half ahead, 39-31.
The second half witnessed a mild comeback by the Highlanders, but more missed shots and a rash of steals by the Lady Mustangs confirmed the win. Cal Poly accumulated 10 steals to Riverside’s three.
The win raised the Lady Mustangs’ record to 4-2 in the California Collegiate Athletic Association and 10-9 overall. Their next game is Thursday at Cal State Dominguez Hills. Game time is 5:45 p.m.

change for Hayward State. The Pioneers brought in lefthander Don Santos, but by the top of the fourth. Cal Poly led by five runs. The Mustangs scored three more over three innings to clinch the game.
Cal Poly starter Lee Hancock pitched a complete game, getting seven strikeouts and allowing five walks. He improved his record to 2-0.
Sheppard was the Mustangs’ leading hitter going into the series, batting .500. He had no hits in the first game, but finished the second with two hits and three RBI. Rumsey also had a good second game, connecting for two hits and two RBI. Clemens, Rumsey and Drew Herron all had doubles in the second game.
The Mustangs hosted Hayward in a single game yesterday. They will be at home again next weekend, when they host a three-game series against San Jose State. The doubleheader on Saturday begins at noon and the game on Sunday starts at 1 p.m.

first basket until five minutes into the period. They managed to pull ahead by five, 32-27, but the Highlanders came back and took the lead, 40-39, with 4:42 left. The lead went back and forth until the Highlanders took a 4S-43 advantage with 42 seconds left.
After a time out. Cal Poly worked the ball around until there were eight seconds left. Mark Shelby then drove to the hoop and shot a layup that missed. Darren Masingale tipped the ball up twice, but to no avail. Finally, Coby Naess tipped the ball in to tie the game, 45-45, with two seconds left. Riverside’s last-ditch attempt to win the game failed at the buzzer.
Naess scored four consecutive points to open the overtime period and the Mustangs never gave up the lead.
“Once we hit the overtime period we began to gain some momentum,” said Masingale. “Earlier in the game we were unable to play consistently and that really hurt us toward the end.”
Neither team had a good shooting night. Cal Poly hit 38 percent of its shots, while Riverside connected on 23 percent.
Naess led the Mustangs with 13 points, while Masingale followed with 12. Naess also led the team in rebounds with 13.
Riverside was led by Juliusl Thomas, who had a game-high 18| points.
