Donn Morris feels that punkers are stereotyped.
The 21-year-old journalism major is what society has labeled a ‘punker.” But Morris doesn’t feel he's a punker.
“1 call myself the average Cal Poly journalism student," he said.
Morris sports a ‘‘mohawk’’ type haircut and wears layered clothing typical of the 50’s. He doesn’t wear dazzling earrings on his earlobes, nor does he wear tattered T-shirts that most everyone typecasts as what a punker should wear
But still, Morris’ appearances have shocked some people and have even caused others to take action against him.
When Morris came to Cal Poly four years ago, he said he looked like ‘‘yoiir average regular high
school student who was becoming a freshman ”
Soon after entering Cal Poly, Morris went through a transformation in his life.
‘‘1 don’t know whether it has to do with dorm-life breeding, though the one I was in was a zoo,” he said. "College turned out to be the whole difference High school was a sort of incubation period.
"In high school you basically knew everyone, you led a very stable lifestyle. Then in college, you hear all the myths about the different people, and you're out there living

oaCl' *^**Wm*
with them-it’s different,” Morris said.
One of the major differences in Morris’ life was the style of music he began listening to.
"1 was into every band in high school-Zeppelin, Van Halen, Aerosmith and Journey to name a few.” He said. "Mainly I was listening to them because everyone else was listening to them. Then a few bands caught my ear and I really liked what 1 was listening to.”
He began to listen to bands such as the Sex Pistols These hands, who were labeled punk rock, approached world concerns and questioned society.
“They were addressing these problems, whereas the others were still singing about the same old stuff-all about love and how my baby left me and
how I got my baby back,” Morris said.
Soon after discovering these bands, Morris’ life was transformed. He got his haircut and slowly began to dress “differently from others.”
He recalls, “When I showed up at Cal Poly, 1 got the haircut. 1 could count the number of people who looked like me on two fingers."
After the change in his lifestyle, Morris noticed a change in the attitudes of people on and off campus.
"Everyone just started staring at me as though 1-
was a stranger. 1 don’t think 1 was any different. 1 wasn't out to say screw you’ I’m going to look different.
“It just pleases me, " he said. I wasn’t out to make any type of statement like ‘Well, here 1 am,’ wasn’t trying to please anyone but me. 1 liked it. It pleases me. Before I try to please or displease anyone,—I’m going tp please me. ” Morris said.
He began to notice people stereotyping him.
"1 couldn’t understand why. When 1 first got the haircut and the clothes, people were very vocal. 1 couldn’t understand why. They’d say things like ‘you godamn punker,’’’ he said.
“I just couldn’t figure that out. If I was walking down the street and saw the strangest person on the earth, I don’t think I would
start calling them names.” Morris said he found many people who thought of his lifestyle as "wild and crazy.”
"You really get a lot of hypocritical analogy-stuff like punkers beat people up is one of the major stereotypes,” he said, "1 can't say that it's not all true, but a lot of it isn't.” Morris recalls a time when a member from a motorcycle gang came up to him and began “screaming in my ear about what he thought of me.” “
He added, "I’ve been pushed around because of

Students react to different
the way I look, but my reaction to it is to act like it never happened. People are expecting a reaction- that I am going to fight back.” The number of people who have changed their lifestyle to that of a punker's has grown. Whether it's a fad or fashion, Morris doesn’t know.
type of thing.”
Because of his punk-lifestyle, Morris knows people view him differently. He knows that when he does start looking for a job things will be different.
"If I were to work on a newspaper or such. I’m sure I would have to look the way a journalist is supposed to look,” he said.
"It depends on the individual. I don’t dislike what people do...it’s their lifestyle,” he said. "People are seeing things out there, and some of them are there just foUowing-the-leader
He added, “I’d be just as comfortable dressing in
that way. I’ll still think the same, I realize that. I have even had instructors who have gone out of their way to tell me that I may have to conform. I lead a lifestyle, but I’ll have to conform to the dress.” "Most employers want to hire a nice, responsible person, and I guess responsible goes into the looks
and dress,’’ Morris said.
Although people think Morris seems strange because of his lifestyle, he said, "I don’t feel at all like a revolutionist—though I 've been blasted by a lot of people because of the way I look.
"People think I’m strange, but I just think they look stranger, he add- ' ed. "I’m not saying that what everyone elM is doing is wrong, but I don’t think that what I’m doing is wrong either.”

"It’s just a choice, something that I’ve decided to do. ”
Editor’s note:	The
reporter was unable to find more willing people to talk about their experiences as “punkers.”

Jesse Colin Young Raitt in a benefit Theatre Feb. 6
will perform with Bonnie concert at the Fremont
People Generating Energy and The Media Project present Bonnie Raitt and Jesse Colin Young in an acoustic performance at the Fremont Theatre at 7 pjn. on Sunday, Feb.6. Lights and sound for the “We Don’t Need Diablo” concert will be powei^ entirely by the sun.
Bonnie Raitt and Jesse Colin Young have actively supported People Generating Energy (P.G.E.) in their opposition to the Diablo Canyon ‘nuclear power plant. The musicians are donating their time and energy to the benefit concert because they firmly believe nuclear power is intolerable and unnecessary.
Their support over the past six years at rallies and concerts has helped P.G.E. promote alternative energies.
Said Bonnie Raitt in an interview, “Stopping nuclei power is not just another cause; it’s a necessity.”
The performers’ musical talent and their strong conunitment to social justice and the environment has placed them among this decade’s top recording artists. Bonnie Raitt’s new band and her eighth album, “Greenlight”, have been greeted with much enthusiasm.
I’ve been trying to find a way to combine my musical career with interest in bringing about political change,” said Raitt.
Solar Genny One, a mobile electric generator which will provide lights and sound for the concert, was designed and built by Solarwest Electric in Santa Barbara.
Genny One is owned and operated by two national solar advocacy groups, ’The Solar Lobby and the Center for Renewable Resources based in Santa Monica.
The two groups sponsor The Media Project to educate people on how they can use solar energy and conservation. The unit generates all its electricity from sunlight. ’The electricity is stored in batteries and converted to AC power.
Concert proceeds will be to continue educating and organizing the conununity on the dangers inherent in the use of nuclear power and the beneficial use of alternative energies.
'Tickets for the acoustic-solar concert are $11 and are on sale at Boo Boo Records, Cheap Thrills, Steve’s Bromeliads in Ba3rwood Park, and the People Generating Energy office at 452 Higuera St. For more information caU 543-8402 or 543-6614.

Nutntionprogram informs students
by Mary Hennesay SlaHWftWf
Food is a word that is easily digested by most Cal Poly students.	''
Yet many don’t realize that the nutrition education program at the Health Center is designed to help them get the most out of what they eat.
“We are an information service,” said Brenda Groves, supervisor of nutrition education. “We want to help students become in tune with tliemselves and their bodies.”
The program involves one-to-one counseluig sessions with 12 nutrition educators available daily from 9 a.m. to noon. 'The student decides the subject to be discussed, but the program specializes in weight loss and gain, on-campus dining halls, nutrition for athletes, basic nutrition, consumerism and vegetarianism. ’There is also a weekly weight control support group from 7 to 8 p.m. on We^esdays.
“Eighty percent of the students that come in are in for weight loss,” Groves said.
Once a student has filled out an assessment form, an educator will put the student on a program or diet that fits his or her individual needs.
“The assessment form tells us why an individual eats what he eats,” said Maryanne Painter, nutrition educator. “It covers everything from family background to favorite foods.”
’The student is also given a commitment card if he or she is involved in a specialized program. The card is designed to be a motivator: On it are short-term goals for the week that the student and educator have chosen.
’The nutrition education program has been at Cal Poly for five years. All of the educators are volunteer dietetics majors.

International universities propose foreign
challenges and stimulation
by Teresa Mari^
StaN Writer
The International Programs office is looking for students intereated in a year of college study abroad.
Cal Poly sends about 100 students to overseas universities each year through the California State Univeraity system’s International Programs. Last year 96 studmts from Cal Poly spent a year at an overseas campus through the foreign study program.
“It isn’t something that’s just for rich Idds,’’ said Holly White, past Alumni Assistant at the Cal Poly ' bran^ of the program. “It’s for swious students who also have a sense of adventure.’’
White said most foreign study programs involve European universities. The most popular and competitive programs overseas we in ajxhitecture and business.
White said Cal Poly’s strength in these two majors ■ accounts for the high proportion of students from this campus who are selected for foreign study programs.
Students can study at universities in 15 different countries through CSU International Programs. Depending on the foreign university they want to attend, students must have at least a 2.75 or a S.OO GPA. Students must also have junior standing by the time thsy intend to leave for overseas study in order to be considered for the program.
All units named abroad will transfer back to CSU campuses, and any financial aid students received in CaUfomia can be applied to overseas study.
The cost of a year of overseas study for a student dspends on the cost of living in the country. It ranges from 94,500 for a year in Mezko to 98,000 for a year in Danmark, according to Joanns LeBaron, this year’s Alumni Assistant for the program.
“It also depends on the extracurricular activities that go along with studies,” shsadded.
White and LeBaron both said a ymr of study at a foreign university impresses proqwctive empk>3rers and helps students get into graduate schools.
Experience in a foreign culture and in foreign studies is something most people don’t have, LeBaron stressed.
Students whose majors and career goals would best coordinate with overseas university study programs are most likely to be accepted to the international study program, LeBaron said.
To bs chosen for the program, students must apply and are then interviewed, indents who want to study at universities in Spain, France, Peru or Brazil must have two years of college study in the country’s language. Students going to Japan, New Zealand, Denmark, and some other countries do not have to have any experience in foreign language.
TTie application deadline for the foreign study program in Feb. 9. Applications are available in the International Programs office in Room 211 in the Dexter Library Building. Interested students can drop by the office or call 546-2915.
Anti-nukes demo inefficiency
On Monday, Jan. 17 and ’Tuesday, Jan. 18, from noon to 1 p.m.. People Genwating Energy will hold a Lenx>nstration (a “Diablo is a lemon” demonstration), to show the economic consequences of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant.
TTm Lemonstration, which will occur at Pacific Gas & Electric’s San Luis Obispo office at 849 Monterey St., will oppoee ratepayws’ support of Diablo Canyon.
Mismanagement, design flaws, poor construction practices and the expenses inherent in nuclear power have driven the cost of the plant up to 93 billion from an original figure of 9315 million, according to P.G.AE.
“With electrical demand dropping, unprecedented conservation by consumers, reserve margiiu about 15 percent over accepted levels, and the cost of the plant going aky high, the riectridty from Diablo Cimyon would be proliibitively expensive and unnecessary,” said Manny Mansbach, a spokesperson for People Generating Energy. “Promisee of power too che^i to meter have proven totally imtrue.”
According to the Wall St. Journal (Aug. 11, 1982), rate increasee of 20 peroent-60 percent have been commonplace in other areas of the country where nuclear plants have recently gone into the rats bass. 17» Edison Electric Institute recently reported that peak s\umner risctrical use, a key measure of power demand, has gone down for the first time in nearly 40 years, leaving the industry with a surplus generating capacity of 38.7 percent, t^ highest since 1938. i
Fresh lemondade will be sold at the Lemonstration. For more information on this event call 543-8402.

Warheads vs. dirt clods
Men host one-sided WW Hi
by Mark Oang
StaH Writer
If Ronald Reagan is serious about cutting the nation's defense spending he ought to consider using the Cal Poly men’s basketball team as an inexpensive deterrent to nuclear attack.
In twenty minutes of action during Friday night's CCAA opener against UC Riverside, the Mustangs’ 1-2-2 zone allowed just two field goals and limited the Highlanders to fifteen percent shooting.
But, just when it looked like a blow-out the Highlanders put on an all-out frontal attack. Using a full-court press, UCR scored the first ten points of the second half to cut Poly's lead to 26-18.
A quick Poly time-out cooled off the visitors and the Mustang lead got no smaller than six points as Ernie Wheeler's troops held off UCR for a 46-37 win.
While UCR was shooting fifteen percent in the first half. Poly wasn’t much better (thirty-three percent!. In fact, UCR outshot Poly for the game — 38.1 to 37.8.
The scoring difference came in the free throw department where the Mustangs outscored the Highlanders 18-5. Most of those came late in the game. '
Highlander head coach John Masi said the dif-
ferenctf in the game was experience. “We have two guys who have played in the CCAA before. When you have a lot of young guys they don't know what to expect. You can’t be kickback and laissez-faire in this league."
You can't win with only four players scoring either. Chris ^ntie and James Fontenette got their averages with 13 and 12 points, respectively, but no one else got more than 6.
Poly’s scoring was balanced as usual. Jim Van Winden and Tom Perkins each scored 8 points to lead the Mustangs.
On Saturday night the Mustangs fac^ a markedly different team, accord-

Women attempt Upset Weekend, upset themselves
by Mike Mathiaon
SMNWtHar
There was very little hope, if any at all, for the Cal Poly women’s basketball team to vqpset No. 1 nationally ranked Cal Poly Pomona Saturday night down south in California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) activity.
So the Mustangs concentrated their collective efforts in upsetting UC-Uverside Friday evening in the CCAA opener for both teams. The Highlanders entered the contest ranked No. 8 in the nation in Division II.
The girls talked all week about beating- Riverside. They knew they had a chance; and weren’t just kidding themselves into believing they had a chance.
But, it wasn’t to be. The Highlanders, who led 40-34 at intermission, held off every Mustang second-half charge en route to a 77-69 win. Saturday night at Pomona, Poly went 0-2 in the CCAA standings as the Broncos whipped the visitors^ 93-47.

The 4-12 Mustangs continue CCAA play this weekend when they host Cal State Northridge and Cal State Los Angeles Friday and Saturday nights, respectively. Both games are scheduled for 7:30 p.m. in the Main 03rm. Going into the Brst weekend of CCAA play, NOTthridge was ranked No. 15 in ^ Division II poll.
Versus Riverside, the Mustangs held All-everything Donna Hammond-Mares to 21 points and 11 rebotinds. Entering ths game, the talented Highlander senior
was averaging 24.5 points and 13.6 rebounds. But, ac-coring to assistant coach Darla Wilson, it’s not what Hammond-Mares did late
in the game which hurt the Mustangs, it’s what she didn’t do-:foul out.
“She had four fouls in the second half and then didn’t get anything else called on her the rest of the game," Wilson said. “And there were times when she could have fouled out. In the second half alone, it’s ^amazing they took 20 free throws and we only had two. ’They’re not that clean of a team.”
’The Highlanders were
15-of-20 from the line in the second half, the Mustangs, were one-for-two. For the game. Riverside was 23-for-30. Poly five-for-nine.
Be that as it may, the Mustangs still had their chances in the second half to tie the game. They were within two a few times, but could never knot the scoft.
"We just didn’t get the bucket we needed at the right time,” Wilson said. “I thought we did a good job on Hammond-Mares. We held her to 21 points and that’s a pretty shallow performance for her.”
The Mustangs had five players score double

figures. Ixeading the point production was Carolyn Crandall with 18. 'Kelly Ulrich • and Terrie MacDonald had 13 apiece, Michelle Harmeier added ' 12 and Nancy Hosken chip- ^ ped in 11. Hosken led the team with 13 rebounds.
'There wasn’t a heck of a bt Poly could do against Pbmona. ’The Broncos raised their record to 14-2. ’niey are 1-0 in the CCAA.
“Pomona is the best Divisbn II team in the nation,” Wilson said.
’The Bron^M shot 57 percent from the field (42-for-71). That’s awesome. “If there would have been a three-point line, Pomona would have made a dozen of them,” Wilson said. "We were in Jackie
White’s face all night and she hit jumpers from the sideline all night. You can’t do a bt with that. We pushed as much as we could.”
“We’re not in Urge numbers,” Wilson said of the Mustangs, who are now down to eight pbyers. Kathy Ferguson is out of actbn for at least three weeks because of a stress fracture in her right foot. “And everyone did expend themselves at Riverside bst night. I think that had a bt to do with our performance against Pomona.”
Ulrich led ths Mustangs’ in scoring against Pomona with 18. She also pulled in eight rebounds. 'Hiat tied Hosken for the team high. Harmeier had seven
caroms, whib MacDonald and Alison Walker pulled in six apiece. Crandall had 14 points.

ASI announcements'
The Student Senate has a number of critical issues confronting it this quarter. Several of these, including the proposal submitted by Mark Roland regarding student review of the instructor’s course syllabus, will ultimate- -ly be voted on by the student body. The, ASI and this newspaper will do their best to inform you of the issues prior to the election in order for you to make a knowledgmble choice.
AtUeticFee
A Senate Rescdution will be presented on Wednesday evening, Jan. 19. that will call for a student vote on an athletic fee referendum that will be used to determine whether or not students support a small fee that will provide support to the intercollegiate sports program and allow free admittance to all sporting events (except football games) for all Cal Poly students.
Smosmer quarter
With the proposed elimination of funding for this summer quarter included in the governor’s bkdget, students must work to persuade the state legilsature of the false economy which tl^ represents. Clearly, if the governor is successful in this attempt, students will be forced to prolong their education and compete more heavily for classes during the regular terms.
Below is* the address of freshman Assemblyman Eric Seastrand, and State Senator Ken Maddy (who is a strong voice on the Senate Finance (Committee). We encourage you to take
the time to explain your concerns to these legislators.
Assemblyman Eric Seastrand State Capitol Building Sacramento, California 95814
Senator Ken Maddy State Capitol Building Sacramento, California 96814 Financial Aid
As the Mustang Daily noted last week, the Board of Trustees of th<h(!SU I ordered an additional $4 fee increase to pay for financial aid. This- unprecedented step indicates a growing move to shift the burden of maintaining access to the CSU to its students, and an abandonment of the state’s respon-siblility. This issue will also be addrass-ed by the Student Senate at an upcoming meeting.
Student Relations Board
Students in statistics, marketing, journalism, graphic design, and otho-fields who ate interested in obtaining experience in developing and implementing surveys, should contact the Chair of the Student Relations Board, Catherine Fraser at the ASI Office (546-1291). The board is responsible for surveying, marketing, and conducting elections.
For more information contact Kevin Moses, ASI Vice President, University Union 217B (546-1291).

Political unconsciousness
Editor
a
Jim Austin's letter on the antiwar movement {Mustang Daily 1/11/83) was disappointing but unsurprising. It was disappointing in the sense that he revealed a complete lack of ' understanding of tbs antiwar movement; it was unsurprising in that he merely reflected the predominantly conservative attitudes that accompany a widespread political unconsciousness.
His criticism of the movement begins, of course, with gross oversimpliBcations of its belief and attitudes. He mistakenly characterizes the “peace” movement as a “hate” movement by saying that iwotestors hated everyone over 30, that minority groups hated whites, that women's liberationists hated men, that ecologists hated science and technology, etc. Hue series of assertions is prejudicial, blatantly false, and based upon a shallow examination of the facts. Protestors did not hate everyone over 30; they hated shortsighted, warmongering policies that were 1) established by local, state, and national governments, 2) rooted in self-interest and self-aggrandizement. 3) philosophically grounded in the specious post-WW II belief that America was “the protector of the FVee World,“ and 4) usually formed by middle-aged men. Minorities did not hate whites; they hated the prejudice and discrimination that were levied against them by whites. Women’s liberstionists did not hate men; they hated the traditional belief system (fostered by men) that locked them into roles as housewives and baby machines. The ecology movement did not (and does not) hate science and technology; it hates the unthinking use of science and technology to the detriment of our precariously-balanced ecosystem. These were and are the real issues, and they sould not be obscured by flippant, coercive rhetoric.
Further, although it is true (as Austin implies) that some factions of the antiwar movement were composed of radical “fringe” groups-the Weather
Underground and the Black Panthers, for example-the movement as a whole cannot be characterized by their activities any more than the Republicans can be characterized by the actions and beliefs of Jerry Falwell or Anita Bryant (or even Richard Nixon). Confusing the mwits of an issue with the character of one of its spokesmen shows weak thinking. something Mr. Austin de^nstrates repeatedly.
Perhaps the most blatant example of this is found in his concluding paragraph. Ignoring for the moment Austin’s indirect assertion that McGovern lost the 1972 election because the antiwar movement supported him (again, an extreme oversimplification of the facts), and also ignoring Austin’s rather bizarre assumption that electing Nixon was a testament to the wisdom of the American public, we are left with his statement that “the abolishing of the military draft and President Nixon’s wind down of the Vietnam War took much of the wind from the sails of the movement.” Think about it. This is equivalent to saying that “granting women the vote took much of the wind from the sails of the suffrage movement.’!| That makes sense; when you accomplish your goals, there isn’t much need to continue pursuing them.
Face it. The antiwar movement was a success. Despite Nixon's invasion (whoops, I mean “incursion”) into Cambodia and his rhetoric about “peace with honor” and “honorable withdrawal” (slogans even mme mindless than “love and peace”), the weight and strength of Amwican opinion was overwhelmingly against the war, and American opinion forced him to mid it. Contending that the American public ignored, loathed, and despised the antiwar movement (as Austin does) ignores historical fact and the flow of current events.
Well, some people still believe that the world is shaped like a pancake, so I guess anything is possible.

Summer quarter needed
Editor:
While many of the budget cuts that Governor Deukmejian has ordered are frightening and unfair, that lack of appropriation of funds sufficient to ke^ Cal Poly in session during the summer, in addition to the former chargee, is downright stupid.
It is true that taking Cal Poly out of function during the summer quarter would serve as an immediate cost reduction, but what would the consequences of this be. Today, many Cal Poly students do not plan to use only the traditional four times three quarters to graduate. The summer sessions, however, have so far provided an excellent opportunity for students to graduate within four years an3rway. If that opportunity is removed, many students will have to delay their graduations and thereby stay longer in the facility. The result heraof hardly constitute any savings per student although, of course, it will mean that there will be room for less new students. At a university that is already impacted, I wonder if anyone in his right mind could justify this.
Another question is that of efficiency and appropriate utilization of the facilities and equipment that the university possesses uid will continue to possess over the summer. Considering the fact that majors such as computer sdsnee are greatly impacted, the facilities in these dq>artments should be used to their fullest. Of course, the sight of an “empty” campus over the summer would also be a heartbreaking one.
Finally, it seems that the timing of the consideration to cancel the summer quarter is very irresponsible. 0>nsider-ing the fact that many students have to plan ahead, a five and a half month warning is clearly insufficient. Then again, who knew that we would get Deukmejian as governor?
I urge all concerned students and faculty members to write Goveri^r George Deulanejian (State Capitol, Sacramento. CA 96814) and ask that sufficient funds be reinstated to maintain the sununar quarter. Part of these funds might be obtained by selling the Governor’s mansion. Then again, we all have different priorities.
