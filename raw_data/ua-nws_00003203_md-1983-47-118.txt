Calculators and mechanical pencils are sharing space lately with literary masterpieces in the backpacks of some Cal Poly engineering majors.
They are men and women with technical majors going for something extra in the English department minor program. Approximately one-third of the 65 English minors at Cal Poly are engineering majors, according to Michael Orth, coordinator and advisor for the year-old program.
Sometimes the load of 27 additional units costs those students an extra quarter or two, but for a variety of reasons they feel the investment of time and effort is worth it.
"Some students feel an English major is not a viable option career-wise, but in engineering they are thirsting in a desert of numbers," Orth said. "For those students. English
classes are a refreshing change.”
Then, too, there is the potential career leverage the minor might give an engineering major.
"The English minor may also give students more flexibility in their profession," said Orth. "TTiere is a problem with illiteracy in business and industry. There is room for people who can write a report or make sense of what others may have written."
Robert Valpey, Dean of the School of Engineering and Technology, agrees with Orth.
"In any and every business. including engineering, the need for communication skills stands out as absolutely essential for advancing in one's career," said Valpey.
"Where an English minor may aid in honing those communiction skills, then it is indeed a valuable thing to have," he said.

Book damage caused by snacking in library
Mustang DaSy—Amy Cgban
Food in the library can cause damage to books and eventually lead to expensive fumigation.
English: a minor for all mayors
includes Shakespeare, American and Victorian literature, advanced composition and English grammar. '
The program, which started winter quarter of 1982, is drawing about 20 sign-ups each quarter, but Orth said he’d be happy to see 200 more in the program.
At least three of the engineering majors see the career benefits and the change of pace from their major as reasons for minor-ing in English.
Roger Hand, a senior Electronic Engineering major said he became aware of the minor program through posters in the English building.
"1 looked at the classes 1 would have to take, and found out I would have taken most of them out of interest anyway. If I wasn't interested in English in the first place, I

Students eating habits cause many problems for the library, the director of the Robert E. Kennedy Library said.
David Walch said crumbs left by snacking students attract silverfish: small wingless insects.
If students mix food into books while studying, silverfish may move into the books and generate, he said. This requires expensive fumigation to correct.
Libraries take many steps to preserve their collections such as a controlled climate.
Walch said food mixed in with books multiplies the problem of deterioration.
Library furniture also falls victim to student dining. Students often spill coffee and other drinks on the couches and carpet in the library, Walch said. He said students also stick
chewing gum under table tops and in cracks between couch cushions.
Students eating while studying abuse library books outside of the library as well.
Walch said the worst case of food stains he has seen at Cal Poly was a book which had been returned laced with ketchup.
Students have gone far in breaking library rules against consuming food there. One student ordered a pizza and had it delivered to the library, he said.
— Walch said students tend to eat in the library more in the evening, but eating starts in the morning with cups of coffee brought into the building.
Students can solve the problems of food damage to library facilities best by doing their eating outside of the library, Walch said.
Students caught eating in the library will be asked
to finish their food outside or to throw it away, he said.
"Fortunately I’ve never encountered a student who did not cooperate when confronted with the problem," Walch said.
"If there was an attitude of belligerence, we would call security.
The size of the library makes food control difficult, Walch added.
With five stories and 2,300 student study spots, a full-time employee would be needed to police the library, he said.
Walch said the library staff tries to catch people with food as they enter the library, but with an average of 5,000 students entering each day, stopping the majority of violators is doubtful.
Walch said he would welcome a student volunteer group to help supervise but has not planned such a group as of yet.
Students process Poly milk
by Kristen Simon StaH Wrilar
With 5,000 gallons of milk and over 400 pounds of cheese being processed every week, the Cal Poly Dairy Processing Plant is certainly a busy little place.
The plant is operated by 25 students, 23 are Dairy Manufacturing majors, and supervised by two foremen and one general manager.
The plant handles all the Foundation’s milk and byproducts, fills orders from Williams Brothers markets, and stocks the shelves of the campus store.
The students work part-time between classes, and have weekends off. Their typical day begins t 6 a.m., but Mondays they must report to work by 4:30 a.m.
"By 2 o’clock you are nodding off in your classes," according to Randall Dei, one of the foremen of the plant.
Dei will be graduating next fall and has a job this summer working for Lucky’s Fluid Milk Plant, but for now he spends most of his time helping to oversee operations of the Cal Poly plant.
Monday, Wednesday and Friday the plant is in full operation processing fluid milk.
“After the milk comes down from the dairy it is stored in stainless steel tanks which hold 2,000 gallons of milk,” Dei said. The milk is picked up from the dairy every other day.
The milk is then drawn
out of the tanks and standardized to 3.5 percent milkfat. "To do this, cream is drawn off the top. Then the cream is used to make other things, like butter,” Dei noted.
"The milk is pasteurized at 161 degrees for 15 seconds. From there it is put into the tiller which puts it into cartons or bags,” Dei said.

School environment affects children’s learning abilities
by Nancy Sringer StaH Wrllar
When a child whizzes down a playground slide he s learning physics, pure and simple. And when that child studies the shap>e formed by touching his ten fingertips together, he's observing an art basic—positive form and negative space.
Discovering educational concepts in the physical environment, and designing effective learning environments was the topic of a slide-illustrated talk presented here Thursday by Dr. Anne Taylor, a professor of art education and architecture at the University of New Mexico.
For the last 15 years Taylor has worked to "marry education with architecture." That is, she considers architecture a medium to teach ideas.
In her work designing schools, Taylor pays close attention to the learning needs of children, incorporating educational concepts into every aspect of the structure and the objects tlut fill it.
In an optimal learning environment, Taylor said, the doors, lighting, furnishings, even the walls "represent some of the concepts that conte right out of the curriculum that we teach from textbooks.”
One illustration of this was a slide showing a snaall cubicle with mirrors on all four inside walls. It is an art
center where children draw their likeness on the mirror by tracing over their image. Taylor said the children are able to draw with great detail this way and she found improvement in later artwork.
The mirrored space also presents the difficult concept of infinity in a way children can see.
Round forms are used as much as possible in the play areas Taylor designs because, she said, they permit eye contact and promote socialization.
To implement some of her ideas would cost more than to build a standard elementary schoolroom, but Taylor also utilizes often overlooked learning tools that are part of any schoolroom.
For example, thousands of dollars are spent every year on teaching aids that show children how various mechanical systems work. Taylor’s philosophy is to uncover some of those systems, such as plumbing and heating, so the students could learn by simply looking at the exposed pipe system.
Another design that Taylor said has been very successful in two ways is a solar greenhouse. Children, who are egocentric, learned to nurture life outside themselves in the greenhouse. The circulating heat system, she added, provided a good comparison to teach ttem about their own circulatory systems.
“Children learn a great many things by themselves,” Taylor said, “but the environment must be well designed and optimally provisioned.”

Dairy plant brings jobs, milk to Poly students
Engineers flock to minor
Frompag«l
The plant also produces seven different kinds of cheme, which are sold in 20-pound blocks. A typical order from the cafeteria is 400 pounds of cheese per week.
The cheese is also distributed to the campus store and Williams Brothers, where it is sold as Cal Poly cheese or generic brand.
“Our cheese is a higher quality than commercial brands because we cure it longer: we have more time,” said Dei.
First, a vat holding 1,000 gallons of milk is filled and cheese culture is added. This is left to ripen and rennett (an en-zymel is added to make the milk gel up. "It gets to be the consistency of yogurt,” Dei explained.
“Then this mixture is cut and cooked,” he added. After this procedure the whey is drained off and cheese curd is left.

“The cheese is vacuum sealed. This keps the air out«and gives the product a longer shelf life,” Dei said.
Milk cheese is cured for three months, medium cheddar is cured four to six months, and sharp cheddar is cured six months. The curing rooms are huge walk-in coolers, their shelves stocked.
All the products produced at the plant are product tested at the plant’s own lab. “Everything is state regulated, so you have to keep on top of it,” Dei explained.
“Everyone who works here is pretty responsible, everyone pitches in,” he added.
“We are a pretty busy little place,” said Dei. “Our pricing must be comparable to that of commercial dairies, because we compete in the same market.
“We have to rely on our name and quality.”
wouldn’t have signed up for the minor. ’Thrfact that it can help me career-wise is just a fringe beneftt,” said Hand.
Hand said he reads books and writes m his free
time, but taking an English class forces him to set aside the time to pursue it.
“You might say it gives me an excuse to take up some time with reading,” he said.
"Another factor is that the poeple in English classes are différait from those in engineeriqg classes, and it’s good to mingle with different kinds of people,” Hand said:
Another Electronic Engineeing senior. Sean McNally, said English classes offer a nice Change
of pace, and could provide him with communication skills important in his field.
“Tve been told by some professors that engineers in the field have trouble because they have good ' ideas but they can’t com-I munieata them. There’s a good chance that communication skills will become important in management positions 1 might want to pursue.” McNally said.
McNally also cited the importance of having a minor in English included on his resume.
“It’s better to go into an interview with a resume that shows an English i minor ratha* than just telling the interviewer I took a ' lot of English classes,” he said.
Stuart Allen, a| sophomore Metallurgical
Engineering major, is minoriu in Philosophy m weD as English.
•‘Oem^ education is important to have.” Allen said. “I don’t want to look at everything from an engineering standpmnt.
"Phil08(^liy is a way of thinking, and English is a way of expressing myself. These . will both be necessary parts of working for myself, which I want to do, eventually.”
And, of course, for Allen there is the enjoyment of reading and writing; the break from engineering classes.
”It’s nice to sit down and havt to read a book.” Allen said. “That’s not to say English is a bed of roses, though. I have tb work at it. too. It’s like anything else: you get out of it what you put into it.”	,

Like WOW!
Chumaah Auditorium on Tueeday avaninfi ia a danfMtws plaça to ba.
< .Yon could ba awaUowed ia a doud of ballooni or daceivod by a group of caiabrity bx^-aUlMs. At once jfou may be pusxled by howls (rf laughter and scraaraing, confused by sudden quiet discussion.
And who know what would happen to you if you were confronted by a Screaming Yellow Zonker.
Dennis Connolly knows. So do more t^n 400 students. All of 4ham are partic^mnta of Week of Welcome, or WOW. touted as one of the largest and moat successful university orientation programs to the western United States. ConnoUy is the WOW. board chairman.
"This year has been the biggest turnout I have ever seen," he said. Indeed, the auditorium is packed with perky people, the cavernous room filled with noise.
The program has thrived for 11 years with the help of volunteer students. They are led by a WOW Boanl which works most of the year. This year’s board
is Timbo Beauchamp. Dab-Iria Foa. Bill Kawaguchi. Mike Ovandon and Bob Schott.
Of course, their reapon-sibility is organising the WOW counselors, but that doesn't mean they can’t let everyone have fim whils they’re at it. Every meeting has a diffsrant theme of drees. 0ns night the students had to dnas accordingto a WOW group symbol. Tersas Smith’s s)rmbol was "screaming Yellow 2tonker." This week all will dress as cdsbrities.
Then there is the serious stuff, discussions and lac-turan on such subjects as communications, stresa reduction, how to look beyond first impresskma and how to deal with handicapped students involved to WOW.
Bob “WOW ” Walters is the assistant director of the Activitiee Planning Center and head of the WOW program. “Success depends on the enthusiasm and integrity of the students going through the training,” he said. "Recognizing that to help-
Av



Riv;'
tog othars. thsy ezpcwience tremsndous pride and personal growth.”
“It’a high ansrgy,” Connolly said of the WOW program. ^"Thara’s a lot, of spirit."	I
1983 WPW logos desiipi-ed by Lyndas Sing and Steve Henny will be used on counselora’ shirts and on buttons and hats.

Qreg Qilbert hurls to Mark Rentree in an unproductive weekend:
Pulling only one win out of a three-game ^weekend with Chapman College, the baaehall team managed at least to fight from falling into tte CCAA cellar with Chapman.
The Muatanga are now 8-16 in league, 8-26 overall, a half game ahead of Chapman in laat, losing Friday night, 11-10 and again Saturday in the game of the double header, 11-6, before finally clouting their visitors in the second game 14-9.
The firat game was a hard-fought, 10-inning bout, with Brian Darling doubling in the ninth to keep the Mustangs in the game tied at 6. Chapman came out in the top of the tenth to bang in 6 runs, none of which Poly could answer.
The second game was a completely
different story. Senior Bruce Carrico had one of the finest games of his career so far, going 3-f«'-4, including a double and 5 RBIs. Lambert uiqied 1^ batting average and ended a sinall slump, while Darling also had a hot time at the plate
For the seniors, including Carrico, Saturday could have been their last game, depending on the outcome of a UC Riyerside makeup game at press time Sunday. Should Mverside lose, the Mustangs will have a chance to {day spoQers Monday at 8 p.m. in San Luis Obispo StacUum in the Highlanders’ attempts to nialte post-season play.
If UC Riverside comes to play Monday, the team will stay for the rescheduled Tuesday double header beginning at 11 a.mi

The Last Worcb
Rose-colored glasses
I wu UsUiiiiig to • now« broadcast about our invohramant in Latin Amarica tbs othar night, whan I raaWaart that parhaps tha biggsst raaaon wa art down than is that wa simply don’t aaa the «mflict through tha ayes of those who ^va in tha region.
Our administration does not understand that tha ptoblams in Latin America atom from the desire of an oppressed people to win their ri^t to a fidl belly.
This inability to view the world as others do causes obvious political pto-blsms. Our laadars seam unable to stay out of distant aituationa they do not. understand. But this problem also effects our personal life because of the blunders and assumptions ws make ' with lovers and frimds.
Before we can.expect our leaders to view the world with a lass jaundiced eye we as individuals must have this ability ourselves.
I don’t pretend to possess this ability to any great extant, but I remember one time when I did see the world through the eyesof a friend, I learned a valued lesson.
It was the summer of 1976, and we were both working in an iron foundry in Loe Angolas.
We worked on the pouring crew, transfaring the molton iron from a huge laddie into molds as big as a Volkswagan Bug. It was a hot. miaarahlaan^dangarous Job.
Besidss Ilia tact we both hated our jobal my friend, and I had almost notUng in common; ha was black and from tha ghetto, I was from tha suburbs and was ths only Caucasian In tha plant.
Wa had a good faisndahip baasd on our woifr. Wa iohad tog^hsr and worked wnl togathar, trying to make an ahnoat unbaarabls job a BtUs saaiar. But our friendship neves went outsids of ths irbn foundry.
I was often confused by his attitudes on Ufa, and tho«^ I Ubsd him I was
shocked to learn that he occasionally would pull a “stick up“ just to get some extra money.
When he asked me for a ride home, one day, Lgot an opportunity to see the world as hie did. and to undmtand his views a little better.
He lived in Compton, in a run-down, black neighborho^. ’There was a number of abandoned cars' in ths strwts, and garbage in the gutters. Hm homes looked old a^ worn out.
As wa pulled Into his driveway ha recognixea my growing discomfort.
“Now you know how I foal in Whitey's world, don’cha?" ha said.
I told him I couldn’t really know how he felt, but that I got the point. Thara eras not a whita faca around, and I Mt uncomfbrtabla.
“Ya know, it woun’t ba too bad if it want fo tha tuba man."
“What ths haD has talsvision got to do arith anything?’’ I askad incredulous-
•y-
“Whsnsvar I turn on tha tuba I saa Whitey,” he said quistly, “Whitey alwajrs look good, nica clothaa. nice house, plenty o’ bread...” Ha gave nm a hard look, “you aaa any o’ that sUt around hare?”
I watched in silence as he got out of the car. cloeed the door ami walked toward his house.
Down ths stipat there was a Itttla girl plasring jump-ropa in front of a bumad-out building, an old lady draasad in rags carrying a grocery bag and a drunk sitting on the curb with his head between his knees.
“No.” I said to myself as my fHsnd entered hie houae. “no. I don’t see any of that shit around here.”

Killer otters
Editor:
In response to Steven L. Rebuck’s letter “SUtus of the Sea Otter,” I would like to thank you, Mr. Rebuck, for enlightening me about those horrible, beastly critters known as the sea otter. With nearly 1,200 of those monsters swimming off the coast of California, I’m surprissd that more people haven’t been hurti Why, just look at how sneaky they are. TIm^ co-habitated with aU tte other marine animals for thousands of years just to get us off^ guard, than—bami—in 10 years they decimated our commercial shell fishing industryl Boy, they must be ravenous! I wonder how many abalone, crabs, and clams that Is per otter, per day?! ’They must be one big eating machine—a mouth, a stomach and a Rebuck! I’m
worried, though. When they run out of shellfish, what’s next? Dogs? Small children? Surfers?
Mr. Rebuck, you scare me. If you and our illustrious Secretary of the Interior James Watt ever got together, 1 doubt there would be much of interest left in California’s waters. I also doubt you have ev«- spent hours trying to hand feed a mariiie mammal that has been blinded and left to die by one of our commercial fishermen. If you would care to try it, or maybe would like to see some of the Dumy other atrocities inflicted by commercial fishermen, come with me some time to the California Marine, Mammal Rehabilitation Center—I think even you would be disgusted! Let’s hear it for “emotional outojes’’-they show we care.	I

Poor coverage?
Editor:
I Coa^wred to moet etudants, I would considsr msrsalf well informed about avente and activities on and off campus that concsm atudants. Many students, though, know very little about what is going on, and raly on ths Daily to inform thsm. Unfortunately, I find that tha Daily covers moet events only after they have occurred, and then provides a tiiort and shaBow account of arhat hap-panad with no background or inaids information on tha event itself. I thought that the sariae of artidas on Poly Royal
and last year’s coverage of Greek Week was not thorough enough to say the least, and there was no coverage of the Paao Robles air shoie with the “Blue Angds”. One of the Angela happened to ba a Cal Poly alumnus who could have been interviewed.
I wish that the Daily could be more proactive in reporting events rather than reactive. Please report events and activitiss before they happen so that the students may be aware of upcoming events.

Help for instructors
To an Henest, Cencemad Student;
Why isn’t it tha reaponaibility of honest students to halp control cheating? If you are not willing to deal with tha problem, why do you foal others should have to deal with it? You claim that it is the “duty” of the instructors to deal with cheating. How can they effectively perform this “duty” if they get no help from the students?
If you were walking down the street some evening and saw two robbers attacking a lady, what would you do? Would you ignore the situation because it is the “duty” of the police to deal with situations like this? I would sincerdy
hops not. I hope you would have enough of a aanoa af naapnnsibflity as a dtisan of
the eommanity to halp the ledr-WhUs 3TOU may argue that the two esses are unrelated, I claim they are similar. In both cases, someons is being hurt (tha lady directly vs. both you and the chsater himself indirectly).
Phase, become a responsible citizen of the Cal Poly community. Don’t pasa the responsibility for controlling cheaters by claiming it h tha instructors’ duty. If everjrons would help daal with ths problem of cheaters, pretty soon ths problem would no longer exist.
