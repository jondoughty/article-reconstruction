Are you? saying that a time of change in administrations also can be a time of change in troubled relationships abroad. “I don’t start off with the view that we always have to be at loggerheads with Iran,” the president-elect said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. He said Iran also could take steps, beginning with the hostage impasse, to demonstrate a desire for better ties with Washington.

Baker III [may have few concrete answers on the incoming [Bush administration’s foreign policy plans when [the Senate Foreign Relations Committee begins [confirmation hearings today on his appointment to be the nation’s 61st secretary of state. Relations with the Soviet Union, arms control, [the Middle East, Central America, and trade are all i issues on which senators will attempt to learn 1 where the new administration stands and where it I intends to go. I A principal concern will be in what areas of foreign policy the Bush administration will differ from the often ideologically rigid positions pursued by the Reagan administration for two presidential terms. But Baker, a friend of the President elect and pragmatic political ally of long standing, may be hindered in his responses by his lack of direct foreign policy experience. President Reagan’s former chief of staff. Baker did obtain experience dealing with the world’s financial leaders as Secre- tary of Treasury. He drew up the Baker plan to deal with Latin American debt. The plan calls for increased lending by commercial banks to Latin America in return for economic restructuring. Some expect Bush, who served as U.S. liaison officer to China and director of the Central Intelligence Agency, will seek to set his administration’s foreign policy direction himself, leaving Baker to manage it. Baker does, in fact, possess,' skill as a tactical policy manager and a clear ability to deal easily with Congress. While senators will seek to learn exactly what Baker will be asked to manage, some are dubious about obtaining concrete results, at least this early in the game. “Baker will duck every substantive question,’’ was the flat prediction of one Democratic staff member who helped plan the two days of confirmation hearings and who asked not to be identified by name. WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) — Newspaper heiress Patty Hearst Shaw says she’s not sure whether President Reagan’s recent expression of interest in her request for a pardon means one will be forthcoming. \"I don’t know,’’ she said during a brief interview Monday with The Advocate of Stamford at her Westport home. “It’s a little premature for anything like that. If he (Reagan) doesn’t approve it, it would go to the next administration.’’ were held in Tehran for 444 days and freed when President Reagan took office. That history has given rise to speculation about the possible release of American hostages in Lebanon as Bush succeeds Reagan. The militant Shi’ite Moslem kidnappers are aligned with Iran, and a State Department official said Tehran can control their fate. Bush and his high command intend to stand on a policy that rules out paying a price for release of Ajnerican hostages, on the ground that if kidnapping is seen as a profitable venture, U.S. citizens around the world will be put at risk. That was Reagan policy, too, but the administration shipped arms to Iran to try to gain hostages’ release. Three Americans were freed in Lebanon during the arms deal period of 1985 and 1986. While State Department analysts believe Iran controls the hostage situation. Bush said in the interview that while Tehran clearly has influence, he is not certain that that government has full control. Bush said that as president he will be “alert to opportunity’’ to gain freedom for hostages, leaving no trail unexplored. “I’m one who thinks that some day we will have better relations with Iran,’’ he said. “And I’m one who thinks it’s in our interest to have better relations with Iran. And I’m one who thinks that Iran can take a handful of steps and demonstrate that they want better relations with the United States. “And so to the degree Iran holds the key, holds most of the keys to unlock the locks, that could be helpful,’’ the presidentelect said. But Bush said he does not hold “the naive view that if you have some dramatic meeting, that’s going to result in the instant release of hostages who are not held by Iran and in some instances may be held by clients of Iran.” Bush said his interview comments visualizing better relations would send a message to Iran — “They’ll read this, they know me ... they know our administration.” Shaw, granddaughter of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, last August quietly asked for a pardon for her role in the 1974 robbery of a bank. She has maintained she was brainwashed by the radical Symbionese Liberation Army, a group of self-styled revolutionaries who abducted her in Berkeley, February 1974. Shaw, now 34, is married and living in Westport with her husband and two daughters.",
