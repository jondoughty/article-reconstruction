    "article_text": "Imagine sitting down to dinner with a family in the Soviet Union. There would be talk, some joking (perhaps aimed at the KGB), a generous helping of steaming borscht and a few good belts of vodka. Yep, that’s what it would be like. At least that’s probably how a lot of Americans see the Soviet Union — like a scene out of the movie “Moscow on the Hudson.’’ Likewise, many Soviets probably see the United States as one big slum. Tattered buildings pack the streets like a crowded elevator and give meager shelter to masses of homeless — the victims of an exploitative capitalistic system. Those are the types of films the Soviet government broadcasts. The truth is, neither country’s citizens, on the whole, have a comprehensive view of the “other side of the fence.’’ After all, said Cal Poly professor of Russian culture Bianca Rosenthal, Soviets aren’t supposed to make contact with foreigners. The Soviet government doesn’t want its people to know what Americans have that Soviets don’t, she added. So not only are Soviet citizens “discouraged’’ from making contact with foreigners, but foreigners, Americans in particular, are “discouraged’’ from rubbing elbows with the natives. One Cal Poly student got a taste of Soviet life in the summer of 1985, though he admits the weekend trip to the “tourist trap’’ of Leningrad in western Russia left him little insight into the lives and thoughts of the Soviet people. Joe Flatley, a 20-year-old sophomore, flew to Finland to meet his girlfriend and the two hopped on a Finnish tour bus into Leningrad. Most of the Fins on the trip only crossed the border to get drunk, the same reason many Americans go to Tijuana, Flatley said. While most Fins on the tour seemed content to stay in the hotel and drink vodka, Flatley hit the streets and began piecing together his impressions of Russia. “Before I went in there (on the bus),’’ he said, “I had a lot of opinions about Russia.” But these preconceptions were later changed by what he saw there. At first, he said, all he saw was army bases and military trucks that made it seem like he was “walking into a big trap ... It felt like the farther I got in — it’s not like I felt in danger — it was just a strange feeling,” he remembers. “It felt like kind of a taboo for an American to go in there. Really pretty countryside, though. Nice drive.” Flatley said he was paid extra attention by the KGB because he was American. They went through all his bags and quizzed him on his ID. He also couldn’t bring his camera in with him. Conversation was one-track at times, when people he talked with dug into their English repertoire. that he hadn’t spent a lot of time talking to the Russian people. He would love to sit down to dinner with a Soviet family, learn about them, tell them about America, and perhaps down a few shots of vodka. “But obviously I didn’t get a chance to do that,” he said. Professor Rosenthal, though, said the Soviet Union is loosening up a bit. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s recent policy of openness is changing things rapidly in Russia and the rest of the USSR, Rosenthal said. Gorbachev’s move to create more work initiative and even small family businesses might allow Soviets to meet more foreigners and learn about America through Americans rather than just literature. “1 think there’s a good chance (for it to happen), but that remains to be seen,” she said. Rosenthal will teach on the London Study Program, in which students will take a trip into the Soviet Union. Rosenthal and others will try for more contact betweeen Americans and Soviet citizens. “Though group efforts to meet Soviets may not work, students talking to Soviets on their own might be more successful,” she said. “The trip will certainly be worthwhile. That’s what everyone’s said who has gone there. It makes them more aware of the world we live in.” Rosenthal said students on London Study will probably find what her students in the Russian culture class and Flatley have found — that the Soviets are people, quite a bit like them. contact,\tand\thealth\tofficials estimate that between 1 million and 1.5 million Americans have been exposed to the virus. While the president has spoken on the AIDS issue before — requesting Koop last Feb. 5 to undertake a study of the problem — he has been largely silent on the issue of giving advice to Americans on preventive and protective measures. In his speech, Reagan noted that the Public Health Service has issued an information and education plan to help control the spread of the disease, which has no known cure. “But let’s be honest with ourselves,” the president continued. “AIDS information cannot be what some call ‘value neutral.’ After all, when it comes to preventing AIDS, don’t medicine and morality teach the same lessons?”",
