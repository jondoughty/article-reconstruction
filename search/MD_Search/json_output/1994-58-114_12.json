    "article_text": "NEW YORK — The New York Rangers are suddenly faced with a prospect alien to their long-suffering fans — they’re favored to snap a 54-year drought without a Stanley Cup. Not only are the Rangers, who finished the regular season with the best record, unbeaten in five playoff games after outscoring the opposition 28-6. But some teams they feared most — Pittsburgh, Montreal and Detroit to name three — were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. Also, the Rangers are free of major injuries and at the top of their game. “We have been successful because everyone has been contributing,” said Rangers’ goaltender Mike Richter. “We have enough pieces of the puzzle together so that evei-y night it’s a different piece.” The Rangers swept the New York Islanders, outscoring them 22-3 in four games. Then the Rangers beat the Capitals 6-3 in the second-round opener Sunday. The Capitals are worn down by a seven-game series with Pittsburgh while the Rangers had a week oft' to heal what minor injruries they had. The two square off once again tonight in Madison Square Garden.",
