    "article_text": "Editor — Last quarter ASI asked the students to agree to a $4 registration fee increase. This allowed for the generation of new scholarships and the increase of existing ones. In appreciation to Cal Poly students, Athletic Director Ken Walker has slapped us in the face by now incorporating priority registration for athletes. As a proud business student, I am appalled by this notion that because a student has chosen to play a sport, he or she should be rewarded by priority registration. Many students in all departments have taken the initiative to excel in their studies, but no priority registration has been suggested to reward them for their accomplishments. In Walker’s quote, “ ... players’ unusual circumstances justify the privilege,\" he implies that all other students do not have unusual cir- cumstances. Band, speech and drama participants have the same responsibilities as do football and baseball players. Both groups must practice regularly and adjust their class schedules to fit their practice schedules. It Is not the responsibility of other students to give up their right of priority registration and allow a select few to take a prima donna role on campus.",
