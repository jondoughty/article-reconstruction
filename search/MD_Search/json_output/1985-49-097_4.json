It seems if Baker doesn’t like the way someone does something — no matter who it is — big changes are soon to follow. Now it’s one of the duties the ASl president — the person elected to represent students — that Baker has decided to cut into. It has been a tradition that the ASI president speak at graduation — it was one of the rights that went along with the job. But Baker apparently didn’t like the speech of Jeff Sanders, last year’s ASI president. So Baker decided an ASI president would not speak at graduation again. He made his decision without talking to the students. (He says it was recommended by the Commencement Committee, but no record of that exists.) Last summer Baker sent a memo to current ASI president Kevin Creighton stating the right of the ASI president to speak at graduation would be taken away. Instead, a student would be chosen based on a academic criteria he outlined in the memo.",
