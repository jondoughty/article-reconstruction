Noel Gayler, former U.S. Navy commander-in-chief, discussed the use of nuclear weapons by the military. Dr. David Holloway of Stanford University discussed Soviet national security. . Gayler, who spent 45 years-in military service, has become a spokesman for the banning of nuclear weapons. A former nuclear target planner, Gayler was asked when he realized that nuclear weapons should be banned. He replied, “I think when I became aware that there was no rationale to the targeting — that we had a targeting policy which said essentially, ‘We’ve got so many nuclear weapons. Find a target for them.’ ” Gayler said the U.S. should enter into a general nuclear agreement with the Soviet Union,to be followed by other countries. There are many illusions people have about nuclear war, Gayler said. He believes these delusions could be eradicated through education and enlightenment. Gayler listed several delusions, including a delusion about the number of weapons in the world. Balance is not the important thing, he said, because the first 100 nuclear weapons would end the world.
