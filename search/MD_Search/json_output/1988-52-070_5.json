The keynote speaker of the seminar will be former U.S. Representative Victor A. Veysey, now director emeritus of the Industrial Relations Center at the California Institute of Technology. Veysey received his master’s of business administration from Harvard University. Student organizers of the seminar describe it as an opportunity for students and faculty to learn from experienced professionals in different fields. “We are very excited about the seminar,” said Pam de la Pena, seminar chairperson. “We have a good mix of people from established corporations as well as many entrepreneurs.” The Cal Poly chapter of SAM is a club designed to prepare students for top management positions in ail fields. Areas emphasized by club activities are managerial skills, goal setting, planning and time management. The seminar is usually a success due to the caliber of professionals who attend, said de la Pena. Cal Poly alumni are cooperative in helping to attract guests and the national SAM organization helps out as well, she said. “This year is good because we have two women speakers coming,” said de la Pena. “It is usually very difficult to get women. so we are happy for this opportunity.” Other events scheduled for the seminar include an MBA panel discussion titled “Business in the 1990s: Planning for the Individual and the Corporation” and both accounting and marketing panels. Although the seminar’s emphasis is on business, de la Pena said it could be beneficial to a variety of students. Issues will be discussed in engineering and computer science as well as other areas.",
