Christ! Jones, a 5’2” resident of Grover City, began classes at Cal Poly this quarter without receiving a high school diploma. Exhibiting intelligence beyond her junior high school peers, Jones and her mother began a “home school’’ where she studied an average of eight hours per day in her home. Before then, Jones attended public schools through seventh grade, but like many other students, grew bored with the environment. The lack of academic challenge left her unsatisfied with her formal education. Eventually a Cal Poly admissions officer heard of her situation and, with his help, Jones found herself at Cal Poly. Jones accepted Cal Poly’s invitation to attend because “of their genuine interest in the students’ welfare,’’ she said. “Cal Poly was interested in my ability to get an education, and the food was amazingly good.’’ Having spent most of her life around adults and feeling less comfortable with children her own age put quite a strain on Jones. “It was almost as though there were two me’s,” she said. .At home, however, her mother could match subject matter with her level of understanding. “I could be me, a whole person,’’ Jones said. When she was younger, she completed the standard I.Q. tests, but the results weren’t revealed until many years later. Jones said she believes this was because of the faculty’s unjustified perception that her parents would push her too hard. Jones considered going to continuation school to earn her high school diploma until she discovered it was only an option available for those 16 years and older. Although test results placed her at a post-high school level, she would be unable to accumulate the necessary credits for a diploma. Advised to proceed in her education with an organization for children like herself called Gifted and Talented Education, Jones seemed to have hit a dead end. Once the media got wind of Jones’ situation, Dave Snyder, Cal Poly admissions officer, called Jones and offered her his support. With the completion of a SAT test with a score 70 points See JONES, page 7 A proposal to channel funds used for faculty merit awards to alternative programs will go before the executive committee of the Academic Senate Tuesday. The proposal, authored by Academic Senate Chairman Lloyd Lamouria, would eliminate the Meritorious Performance and Professional Promise (MPPP) awards distributed annually to faculty members. It suggests the distribution of funds currently used for the award to “enrich such already established, but inadequately funded, faculty development programs.’’ These programs include sabbatical leaves, travel funds, grants for research and conferences to be used for professional development. The 123 awards of $2,500 each are distributed proportionately to the seven schools on campus. Funds were allocated from the state budget to create the MPPP. Approval by the executive committee would send the proposal to a meeting of the full senate April 14. Although passage of the proposal would not initiate action on the part of the senate, it would represent “the Academic Senate’s stand on the issue,’’ said Lamouria. Lamouria said the proposal reiterates the position taken by the senate a few years ago. “We didn’t agree with the MPPP awards to start with,’’ he said. “We feel that they are divisive as far as the faculty goes.’’ Adelaide Harmon-Elliott, Cal Poly president of the California Faculty Association, said that the MPPP awards were agreed on as a compromise’ during the final round of contract negotiations three years ago. The CFA is a union that serves as the elected bargaining agen\\ for Cal Poly faculty members. “The CFA asked for more money for professional develop- “The eSU ^ wanted a merit system. The compromise ended up to be the MPPP.’’ A factfinder settled the dispute with the following agreement:\tthe faculty through the Academic Senate would devise the criteria for the awards, and deans would make the final decision based on faculty input. Physics professor Thomas Schumann said, however, that faculty members have little input into who receives the awards aside from the nomination of potential recipients. “There’s no clear criteria for the award,’’ he said. “The final decision is President (Warren) Baker’s. He can veto any nominee.’’ Schumann added that administrators work as a team, and that the Academic Senate accepts what the Administration asks for “The decision is made, and you never know who made it or who they discussed it with. The whole thing is very nebulous,’’ he said. “I think there is a possibility of misuse.’’ Articles appearing in Mustang Daily in May 1985 reported a “purely random selection process’’ used by schools such as Professional Studies to select nominees for approval by the dean. Five of the seven schools, however, said that no random selection process was used. At that time, only 39 awards for a total of nearly $100,000 were given. Lamouria said nominations for the award are forwarded by department heads to an elected school committee, which forwards its recommendations to the school dean. If the dean ap-See MERIT, back page Well, it’s over. Finally. And not a minute too soon. In fact, the Academy Awards show lasted exactly three hours and 21 minutes too long. On Monday this annual Hollywood extravaganza forced itself upon the American public and was received about as warmly as a pop quiz. Except, unlike a pop quiz, we were warned about the Academy Awards. We knew they were coming. They’ve been coming at us live from Hollywood for 59 obnoxious years. And they’ll keep coming, just like the flu. Actually, the show wouldn’t be so bad if only the meaningful parts were televised. Does the television audience really need to know that “ ’Round Midnight” had the best score? What was the score, anyway? By how much did it win? And does the man on the street really care that “Precious Images” was the best live-action short film? Maybe. But then why don’t they give an award for the best non-action long film? Ronald Reagan’s last news conference would be a good nominee. To continue in the true spirit of the awards, perhaps the academy ought to consider the following meaningful categories for next year’s presentation: Best Valet Parker at the Studio Parking Lot — Nominees will be judged on their speed, attire and knowledge of restaurants within a 10-mile radius. Most Original Excuse for the Film Going Over Budget — Directors and producers have come up with some creative ones and the Academy should recognize the genius of these artists. The awards are well on their way to becoming the most lavish, excessive and exorbitant non-event in the history of mankind. All the show needs is a few extra categories to stretch the presentation into a two-day fashion parade and it would be, without a doubt, the most worthless program ever endured by human audiences. Although the Academy Awards are based on an ideal of recognizing artistic excellence in the movie industry, they’ve become an evening devoted to activities that don’t interest anybody but the actors and ac- t tresses themselves. Maybe if the television viewing public is lucky, next year’s envelope will say “Program canceled due to lack of interest.” WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate Wednesday tentatively sustained President Reagan’s veto of an $88 billion highway bill on a vote of 65-35, but majority Democrats moved immediately for another vote in a high-stakes political showdown. “The American people are being shafted by this vote,” said Senate Democratic Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who switched his vote at the last minute in a parliamentary maneuver that enabled him to seek a second roll call. But Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said, “In my view it’s over. We’ve won it fair and square.’’ Among the California Senators, Democrat Alan Cranston and Republican Pete Wilson were among the 65 votes “for” the override, which required a two-thirds approval of the Senators to pass. US agrees to discuss trade WASHINGTON (AP) — The Reagan administration, while standing fast to its plans for sanctions on Japanese electronics imports, has agreed to a Japanese request for “emergency consultations’’ in the intensifying dispute over computer chips, U.S. officials said Wednesday. A team of Japanese trade specialists will arrive in Washington on Friday for negotiations with their counterparts in the departments of State, Commerce and office of U.S. trade representative, the officials said. The semiconductor talks, to get under way in earnest on Monday, will be followed later in the week with meetings in Washington among higher-level trade officials of both nations, government spokesmen said. HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) — A judge’s upholding of a surrogate parent contract in New Jersey after an Indiana judge ruled one invalid last year heightens the need for laws to clarify the sensitive issue, lawyers said Wednesday. “Surrogacy has potentially devastating civil liberties implications for all parties involved. We have to proceed very carefully and very thoughtfully,’’ said Susan Sangree, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Reproductive Freedom Project in New York City. Superior Court Judge Harvey R. Sorkow’s 121-page decision in the “Baby M’’ case Tuesday granted custody of the year-old girl known as Baby M to her father, William Stern. It denied parental rights to Mary Beth Whitehead, who had agreed to bear the child for Stern and his wife, Elizabeth, via artificial insemination. Mrs. Stern adopted the baby Tuesday. Attorneys for Whitehead, who had changed her mind after agreeing to a $10,000 surrogate contract, filed for a stay of the decision Tuesday. They said the case probably will be appealed directly to the New Jersey Supreme Court, and that arguments are expected within four months. Sorkow’s strongest message, legal experts said, was a call for help from the nation’s legislatures. No state regulates surrogate parenting. Sixteen states have delved into the issue, with bills either pending or defeat^ in The New Jersey and Indiana rulings set precedents for those states only, but lawyers and judges can refer to them while considering similar cases nationwide. In the Indiana case, Superior Court Judge Victor S. Pfau invalidated a surrogate contract, saying fees paid to the surrogate mother constitute profiting from adoption, a Class D felony under state law. He ruled a mother cannot agree to give up her child until after birth. “1 think that there is always going to be a lot of conflicting law out there,’’ said Nadine Taub, a Rutgers University law professor. “This shows we need legislative clarification.’’ Sorkow called for laws to, establish standards for sperm donors, legitimacy of the child, and the rights of the parents’ spouses. He also suggested there should be laws to determine the qualifications of a surrogate, whether payment to the mother should be allowed and remedies if the child is born impaired. “It took years of legislative debate and judicial inquiry to define and develop today’s laws of abortion and artificial insemination,’’ Sorkow said. “The issues of surrogacy are still evolving, but it is necessary that laws be adopted to give our society a sense of definition and direction if the concept is to be allowed to further develop.’’ Attorneys agreed that most states will likely pass laws regulating surrogate motherhood. “Some (people) were scared to talk to you, seems like,” he said. Others seemed interested but wouldn’t approach him. “There are some good-looking girls there,” he quickly added. Flatley said the natives “probably thought the tourists were jerks,” and that Leningrad by no means represents the rest of the Soviet Union.\t“I’m\tsure\tif you go out in the\tcountryside it\twould be dif- ferent,” he said. One stereotype that happens to be true is that Soviets spend a lot of time standing in line for food and other needs. “There was\tthe meat\tstore\tand\ta big line in front of\tthat, and\tthere\twas\tthe bread store and a big line in front of that and there was the vegetable store and a big line in front of that!” he said. One thing that bothered Flatley, though, was that the stores would put him at the front of the line because he was American. “People didn’t say anything,” he said. “They just stared.” Despite the military cars and taxis speeding and swerving chaotically through the streets and obeying no traffic laws (because there aren’t any), Flatley was impressed by the beauty of the architecture in the clean but colorless city. The Catholic Russian Orthodox church “was the hugest, most immense church I’ve ever seen in my life,” he said. “There was gold everywhere — a lot of statues and paintings, and a lot of old ladies would walk around to each and say a little prayer and kiss it ... and you couldn’t touch anything unless you were an old lady,” he joked. PHILADELPHIA (AP) — President Reagan, in his first major speech on the health crisis, said Wednesday that local schools and parents must decide how to educate children on the threat of AIDS but also must stress morality and avoid a “value neutral” approach. “All the vaccines and medications in the world won’t change one basic truth — that prevention is better than cure,” Reagan told the Philadelphia College of Physicians, one of the nation’s oldest professional medical associations. “We’ve declared AIDS public health enemy No. 1,” the president said. And he pledged, “I’m determined we’ll find a cure for AIDS ... we’ll find a way or make one.” Supporting statements by Education Secretary William Bennett, he also said the dissemination of such information “must be up to the schools and the parents, not government.” Until now, the administration’s principal spokesman on the issue has been Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. He has taken a more aggressive stance than Bennett, saying that beyond abstinence, the surest protection is the use of condoms and the education of children as early as the third grade. But Reagan also told reporters that he doesn’t quarrel with Koop’s advice on prevention. Asked earlier if people should “just say no,” Reagan replied, “That’s a pretty good answer. Yes.” LOS ANGELES (AP) — Dean Martin’s family and celebrity friends gathered Wednesday at a brief memorial service for son Dean Paul Martin, the actor-pilot killed with another flier on a California Air National Guard training flight. The private 25-minute military service at Los Angeles National Cemetery in West Los Angeles included a fly-over in missing-man formation of four planes from the 163rd Tactical Fighter Group, the unit in which Martin, 35, was a captain. Among those attending the service along with Dean Martin were longtime show business friends Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. and Martin’s former comedy team partner, Jerry Lewis. Also attending were Lucille Ball and producer-husband Gary Morton, composer Henry Man-cini, actor-singer Shaun Cassidy, entertainer Danny Thomas, boyhood friend and former bandmate Desi Arnaz Jr. and Martin’s former wife, ice skater Dorothy Hammill. Meanwhile Wednesday, recovery teams continued searching 90 miles east of Los .Angeles for remains of Martin of West Los Angeles and weapons officer Ramon Ortiz, 39, of Las Vegas, Nev., whose jet crashed March 21 in the San Bernardino National Forest. higher than freshman entrance requirements, combined with work approved by faculty members, Jones was allowed to enroll at Cal Poly. Jones likes music and the works of Shakespeare and Hawthorne, but said she is no more intelligent than the average person, “just a little more motivated.” She was so motivated she attended class with her mother at Santa Barbara Business College. After that — her first college class: “I knew that’s what I wanted,’’ she said. Her first quarter here began with a schedule of five classes. So far, she said, “I love the atmosphere. I feel very comfortable.’’ She has made several friends already. Some know how old she is, she said, and others don’t, but they don’t treat her any differently. “I am happy to be with people who care about learning. They aren’t here because it’s required.’’ •Ian Cannon, a member of the technical staff for the Rocket-dyne Division of Rockwell International, will present a speech entitled “Rocketdyne Presents Robotics.’’ The program is sponsored by the Cal Poly student chapters of the American Welding Society and the Society of Manufacturing Engineers and will be held today in Room B-5 of the Science Building. Admission is free. •The Cal Poly English department will sponsor Helge Ronning, professor of Scandinavian studies at the University of Oslo, Norway.

The number of other divisions based on age, bike size, etc.,” said Lalor. The A class is the most difficult run, B is intermediate, and C class is the least difficult set of loops. ‘‘The terrain for the race is near High Mountain in Pozo, California,” said Lalor, ‘‘and is a great setting for this type of Enduro racing.” Riders also draw for starting numbers in the Enduro. ‘‘Four riders leave every minute,” said Lalor, ‘‘and must maintain constant speeds between checkpoints to avoid being penalized for going too fast or too slow.” ‘‘The race is really about rider ability, endurance, and overall skill,” said Poly Penguin treasurer Mark Bader. This year class A and B riders rode for about 85 miles and those in the C class rode 65 miles. ‘‘Speed does not win the Enduro,” said Bader. ‘‘Keeping a certain speed over a difficult terrain does.” Overall winners of this year’s Enduro were Pete Postel on a 125 Honda CR in class A, Jim Williams on a 250 KTM in class B, and Michael Nichols on an OPE Honda in class C. ’ Trophies, ribbons and finishing pins were just some of the prizes that went out to riders in the Enduro. ‘‘We try to congratulate all the riders,” said Bader, ‘‘even for just being able to complete the race.” ‘‘Sunday was the perfect day for the race because the rain earlier in the week settled down j the dust and made for good traction.” There were few complaints from the riders who participated in the Enduro. Mike Spanger, an Enduro rider said, ‘‘It was a real- ly good race. It wasn’t as technical as it had been in the past so it was more enjoyable. The last six miles of the loop were the best and were a challenge because of the risks of bottlenecks.” Bottleneck is a term used in motorcycle racing where there is one trail up-hill and a rider stalls, backing up all riders behind him. ‘‘This is the biggest problem with any race,” said Bader. Poly Penguins are part of District 37, which includes the Los Angeles area. Bader said the Enduro is a good race for this area. ‘‘Most of the riders in this district don’t get the chance to ride this type of terrain that often,” he said. ‘‘All the riders look When the race started in 1950, riders went through the city and out to Avila. ‘‘Now the competition is strictly off-road,” Bader said. Participants in the Enduro race also include former Poly Penguins. ‘‘They come back not only to race,” said Lalor, ‘‘but also to see films of previous years’ races and just to have a good time.” Cal Poly Penguins is one of the only college motorcycle clubs around. ‘‘No one has ever challenged this claim,” said Lalor, ‘‘and we even get students coming to Poly because of the Engineering technology, mechanical engineering major Pete Robinson is just one example of this. ‘‘Granted, I was considering Poly for other reasons,” he said. ‘‘The fact that they had a motorcycle club just made it that much more attractive.” While the Enduro race is the biggest event of the year for the Penguins, the group is planning another event for Poly Royal, Lalor said. Trails riding is scheduled to take place during Poly Royal. ‘‘These are events that concentrate on rider balance,” said Bader. ‘‘The bikes are lightweight and the riders go over vans and cars.” Court gives OK to airline merger WASHINGTON (AP) — A Supreme Court justice cleared the way Wednesday for the $860 million merger of Delta Air Lines and Western Airlines, vacating a lower court injunction that would have blocked the merger due to a dispute over union representation. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor approved the application by Western and Delta attorneys to vacate Tuesday’s ruling by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, said Kathy Arberg, Supreme Court spokeswoman. ‘‘That means the merger can take place,” Arberg said.

In the case of a disagreement on the dean’s part, the nominee’s application is forwarded to Baker. Only a small percentage of the nominations ever reach the president, he said. The awards exist throughout the CSU system, and are encouraged by the Chancellor’s Office and the state Legislature, said Lamouria.

Threats to faculty members’ tenure or promotions could inhibit instructors from voicing an opinion on university and controversial issues, said Schumann. “There is a history of fear of retaliation at this university.’’ He added that professors often speak up on issues after they have become tenured, but non-tenured faculty members “just don’t like to make waves.’’ Although the awards have been opposed by both the CFA and the Academic Senate, faculty members stand on both sides of the issue. Lamouria said that like any issue, MPPP awards have those who support the idea and those who don’t. Harmon-Elliott said current contract negotiations are in the fact-finding stage, and that the CFA has asked for MPPP awards to be eliminated in the new contract. “We have asked for the money to be dumped into professional development,” she said, adding that faculty members are required by contract to participate in professional development activities. She said the CFA hopes to have its answer on the issue by the end of April.",
