    "article_text": "I think evaluating teachers could be either a positive or negative thing. In a positive manner, I just transferred into the English major and I have no idea which professors are real good and which ones aren’t. I think it can be a positive thing to get the most out of your education. From the negative aspect, I think students are obviously going to flock to the teachers they’ve heard are good. That will make the classes impacted and people are going to want to add those classes. Overall I think it’s a tough choice. I think evaluations should be made available to the students so we can pick our teacher, but since CAf*TURE makes it impossible anyway, I guess it all doesn’t really matter much anyway. It would be good to see them but I don’t think it would change much because classes are always full anyway. ASI government should be in charge of getting it together and getting them out to students. It seems like they don’t get much done. What do they do, anyway? I never see any results. I guess they get money from our tuition so they should do it. I would like to know what other students have to say about a teacher before I take them. A lot of times you don’t have the access or know someone that has taken a professor before and you’re faced with about four different teachers. An educated decision can make a difference in the course. If they’re well-thought-out evaluations, they could give the good and the bad about a teacher and give everyone a more educated choice. Not that through CAPTURE you can really choose anyway, but overall it’s a good idea. I think it’s fine. I’m in favor of it. I think students deserve to know more directly instead of through the grapevine what teachers are really like. They can get that through evaluations if they’re well done. The English department has a good evaluation form. Students find these things out anyway, don’t they? Why not just make it all available and eliminate the middleman. I think that we should definitely have instructor evaluations because it would help students make a choice that would improve their education. If they wanted a challenge they could take a difficult teacher. I don’t think hard teachers would be avoided because students basically want a good education. I read that commentary about it (Mustang Daily, Jan. 10) and there should definitely be a special publication. It should be done by a club on campus, possibly ASI — but definitely not administrators. It would be a good reference for incoming freshmen — they could get a basic student opinion. I think it’s a great idea because there are a lot of great teachers out there with a lot to offer. There are a lot of great teachers out there. If recommendations were let out, you could take their class without having to worry what kind of professor you’re going to get. It’s a great idea because overall, it would keep education at a higher level. Better teachers would be recognized for their abilities and would get fuller classes. Students have to take the teachers so they should be able to see all the opinions of the teacher. When she was seven months old, she was bitten by a mosquito and infected with encephalitis. She went from being a healthy bouncing newborn to a patient in a Los Angeles hospital — blind, deaf and paralyzed. She showed no response to stimuli, not even sunlight shining in her eyes. Doctors told her mother she would always be this way. They said she should be put in an institution. Jean Blackburn was not ready to give up. Today, with the help of a devoted mother and dedicated volunteers, 7-year-old Katherine Blackburn can see, hear and read at a third-grade level. Her motor skills are improving every day. Her progress is the result of a controversial form of home therapy called “patterning.” “She’s come so far,” Jean said. Katherine’s first form of patterning gave her sight and hearing back. “We put her in a dark closet on top of a box with a Plexiglas top. There were 1,000 watts of light and basketball-type horns. They went on and off every two seconds. We had to wear earplugs. We did it 15,000 times, 25 times a day for eight months. “I remember one night I was sitting on the futon with Katherine in my arms thinking ‘I can’t go on. I can’t do this anymore.’ I turned on a flashlight to find something, and she squinted. It was her first facial expression. I said, ‘Oh God, its working.’ ” Patterning is a form of therapy in which continuous stimulation provides the opportunity for the healthy parts of the brain to take over for the injured portions. The stimulation breaks through the neurological blocks. Patterning, however, is not recognized as a valid form of therapy by the American Medical Association. “I patently disagree,” Jean said. Skeptics say that a patterned child’s success is not due to the treatment, but is something that would have eventually happened regardless, she said. “It may not work for everybody. Children that should be patterned need to have parents that are willing to do it,” she said. Jean says she is frustrated because she receives no money from the state for Katherine’s therapy. If she had put Katherine in an institution, the state would have to pay for it, she said. In countries like Italy and Norway, Jean said, the state subsidizes patterning by paying for a tutor and live-in help. “I’ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain. It’s hard enough to just get through everyday life with a hurt kid, but I’ve got to give her a better life,” Jean said. Jean says, “Katherine loves her intelligence program more than anything.” Jean says that Katherine answers with her eyes. Jean is quick to add that just because the motor skills may not be there, it doesn’t mean the intelligence isn’t. “This is a brain injury. This Jean was a costume designer for ABC television in Los Angeles. Now, Jean cannot go out and get a job. Katherine is her job. Jean says that as a single parent, she has a hard time covering the costs of Katherine’s therapy. Katherine and Jean must visit Doman’s Institutes every “When he (the doctor) told me to teach her how to read, I thought, This guy’s insane.’ But it gave her something to accomplish.

Students need to be aware of home health care issues. If somebody you love has a stroke, you’re the one that’s going to help them, can’t just hand them over,” she said. Right now, Jean is looking for a boarder who is willing to trade rent for patterning time with Katherine. Before Katherine got sick. six months to determine Katherine’s progress and the future course of her therapy. “I know she’s getting better because she’s starting to act like the “well” kids on the airplane — she complains more,“ Jean said with a laugh. “I admire her so much just for what she’s been through and how hard she tries. It’s a lot harder than anything we can liken it to,” Jean said. We need people capable of going beyond half-full or half-empty thinking. People who see subtleties. Who are quite frankly bored by easy answers and off-the-shelf solutions. People who are constantly challenging their own thinking and are thirsty for new ideas and knowledge.
