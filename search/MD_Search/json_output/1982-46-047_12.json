A tMm of four architecture and construction students, equipped with bronzed shovels and yellow hard hats, initiated construction of a pedestrian bridge 'niursday that will lead to the Erhalt Agriculture Building at ground breaking csrenxwiee. The pedestrian bridge, which will extend fimn Inner Perimeter Road to the second floor of the Agriculture BuikUng, was designed and planned by studaats. Akoady ^tproved by the university, the bridge will be funded by outside sources. Paul Dooley, chief architect and pro--Ject coordinator, said he is very ezdted about the i»oject, which has taken almost a year ami a half to finalize. \"The bridge should cut down traffic in the buUding’a stairway, aid handicapped students and provide an educationid evperisnce for at least 20 students,” said Dooley. The bridge should be completed sometime in May, according to Etooley. Not including labor costs, Dooley said the estimated costs of material and sot-vices are $15,000. Hm finished value of the {Hoject, including labor would be approximately $36,000. Dooley said designs for the bridge began as his senior project, but because of the enthusiasm s^wn for the project he was joined by others who wishsd to see the bridge plans carried through. Other meml^s of the planning team include Ralph Teysaier, chief engineer of the project, and Eric Dybevik and Joe Laidsinski, both construction majors. Along with the planning team, the 20 other students who participate in the project will enroll in a special project class and receive dective credits. \"Tlie project is a tremendous learning experience and provides students with an understanding of the whole i»t)oess in the industry,\" said John Stuart, teculty adviser for the project.
