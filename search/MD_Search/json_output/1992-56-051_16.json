    "article_text": "Horseback riding is the number-one pleasure industry, both in numbers of pteople involved and in number of dollars, Armstrong said. Riding horses gives a sense of therapy, both physical and mental, said Armstrong. Students take this class for a number of different reasons, he said. Some take it because they want to work in the horse industry, others for the horse experience or just for the pleasure of working with horses. “I’ve always been interested in horses. This is my last quarter here at Cal Poly, and I wanted to able to enjoy this class while I can,” said John Scott, a civil engineering senior. Armstrong said, “You have to be honest with horses. They deserve your resptect. They’re sensitive, gentle and kind. If you think you’re pretty tough, a horse will make you think about that one more time.” As an instructor, Armstrong says the greatest feeling of satisfaction comes from seeing a student develop a love for horses. “It appears like something deep inside of them was moved when it happens.”",
