    "article_text": "After an inspiring start, the Cal Poly Mustangs exited the NCAA Division II Western Regionals due to a sputtering offense. The Mustangs, ranked No. 13 in the nation, bowed out after being shut out for 14 consecutive innings. Poly lost Sunday to the top-ranked Cal State Bakersfield Roadrunners, 3-0, in a game that determined who would advance to the regional finals. Bakersfield’s Kristine Karr blanked Poly for seven innings, getting five strikeouts and one walk. Pbiys starting pitcher Julie Rome went all the way for the Mustangs. Rome, entering the regionals with a 23-4 record, gave up two earned runs. The Roadrunners scored all their runs in a three-run third inning. On Saturday, the Mustangs beat Portland State, 3-2, in the regional’s opening contest. Poly, however, then went into its offensive drought as they lost to Cal State Hayward, 1-0. Bakersfield advanced to the regional finals against Hayward, who went into Sunday’s game undefeated. Hayward had downed the Roadrunners, 3-2, in their opener.",
