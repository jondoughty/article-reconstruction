Chicago Bulls add “bad boy” Dennis Rodman to roster (AP)--Dennis Rodman’s game is as unique as his personality and now he will have to blend those talents with two stars who were once bitter rivals, Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Rodman, the NBA’s top rebounder for the last four years, was voted the league’s best defender in 1990 and 1991 and helped the Detroit Pistons win a pair of championships. Last season he collected 20 or more rebounds in a game 20 times, including a a season-high 30 against the Houston Rockets. Rodman, who averaged seven points during aturmoil-filled season with the Spurs last year, said he can play with or against anyone. But Rodman, who is set to make $2.5 million in the final year of a contract this season, said he isn’t going to Chicago just to play with certain players.
