    "article_text": "ASI has announced the members of the IRA Referendum Task Force. The task force’s goal is to educate students about the upcoming sports referendum. Bruce Sherman, ASI marketing coordinator, is the group’s chairman. TTie 10-member student group meets every Thursday until the November election, Sherman said. Other members include: Bart Walker, recommended by the agribusiness department; Chris Frotinger, recommended by the statistics department; Dyana Wong, a home economics senior who volunteered for the group; Gabe Joynt, ASI Finance Committee member; Joe LaRosa, recommended by the agribusiness department; Kristin Burnett, a member of the ASI Executive Staff; Margaret Mitchell, a Poly women’s basketball player; Rex Smith, recommended by the business department; and Tim Kraus, a former member of the Poly Royal Board. After a nationwide search. Cal Poly has hired a director for its ethnic studies program. Bob Gish, an English professor from the University of Northern Iowa, was selected from three finalists and has accepted an offer to fill the new position on campus. “He is really philosophically committed to this program. He was my personal choice of the three candidates interviewed. He is an excellent teacher and a University Distinguished Scholar in Iowa,” said Sidney Ribeau, dean of the School of Liberal Arts. In a telephone interview from Cedar Falls, Iowa, Gish said he has written three analytic-style history books, one literary biography, one volume of short fiction and “literally hundreds” of articles for publications such as the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune. His specialty fields are American, ethnic and American Indian literature. Gish is a Cherokee/Choctaw Native American who grew up in New Mexico. He said he accepted the position partially because he had “been homesick for the West for a long time,” and because he likes San Luis Obispo. Gish said he is looking forward to implementing the new program. “TTie university needs to move ahead on an ethnic studies program,” he said. “They made me an offer I couldn’t refuse,” he said of his tenured, full-professor position. Ribeau said Cal Poly wanted to hire Gish full-time when he was here last winter and spring quarters as a visiting scholar. “He was on leave, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to leave his job in Iowa to come here and start something totally new,” he said. Gish said about resigning from Iowa after 25 years of teaching, “I had mixed feelings about it. It’s one of those bittersweet things, but I’m up to the challenge.” Gish accepted the offer at the beginning of October and will start his new position in January. Willi Coleman, director of the Center for Women and Ethnic Issues, served on the interviewing committee along with two students and four professors. “I was impressed with the fact that he (Gish) exhibited interest in ethnicity,” Coleman said. “I would like to see the university commit itself. “We behave as though ethnicity is something foreign to us.” Coleman said most universities require an ethnic studies course as part of their general education requirements. Cal Poly is the only California State University school that does not offer a minor, major or concentration in ethnic studies, Ribeau said. The resolution passed by the Academic Senate endorses an improved ethnic studies program. It will be a long while, however, before courses become required due to the laborious curriculum-change process, Ribeau said. Gish’s duties as director will include identifying funding for new ethnic studies programs and locating money for seed (privately funded) grants, providing support for faculty in developing new courses in the area, developing a cultural diversity lecture series, acting as a liaison with other campuses and perhaps setting up a visiting scholar program. “What I want to do is reconcile differences,” Gish said. “I’m ready to move forward on an ethnic studies program.” Ribeau said the number of classes offered (currently two: Sec DIRECTOR, page 7 Faster than the fastest Mac.

Our foundinfi fathers drafted the Second Amendment to the Constitution to protect the country and its people. They believed Americans in the 18th centuiy needed to possess arms for protection against government tyranny and to maintain local militias. But the times and the needs of the country have changed. Too many guns are falling into criminal hands. TIk) many weapons wth the sole purpose to kill people quickly, efficiently and en masse are available — and being used. Too many people are dying. The time is now for the country- and its people to get some protection from the instrument that once helped ensure their freedom. Guns now are almost as ubiquitous as dirt. In 1989, U.S. gun manufacturers pumped out more than 4 million non-military pistols, revolvers, rifles and shotguns. Foreign manufactures imported thousands and thousands more. In 25 states, a person can purchase a shotgun at a K-mart by simply plunking down the money and showng a driver’s licence. If the person wants a handgun, the license has to be from that state. Guns are being ciimed not only by men and women, but by children as well. The Los Angeles Times in early October quoted an estimate that as many as 90,000 American schoolchildren carry guns to class every day. These are signs that gun use is in desperate need of control and restriction. The extremely high volume and availability of weapons in the country has been instrumental in creating social problems and augmenting existing ones. Many options exist that can effectively put gun use under control when used comprehensively. •\tEstablishing waiting periods for handgun purchases. Waiting periods would allow police agencies to check the purchaser’s criminal and mental-health record and therefore keep guns out of the hands of people prohibited to carry them. •\tA ban on all assault rifles, pistols and large ammunition clips. These are measures that outgunned police agencies have been advocating for years. A ban on these items would make killing sprees like the one in Killeen, Texas almost impossible. It would also make them much harder for criminals and gangs to obtain. •\tMandated safety features. Longer barrels would make guns harder to conceal. A ‘loaded chamber indicator” (which tells if the gun is loaded) would prevent accidental shootings. Combination locks would make it harder for criminals to use stolen firearms. These features are feasible with current technology. Firearm advocates, however, say that these measures would be either ineffective or infringe on their rights. These arguments have all the power of a pop gun. Gun control opponents say waiting periods would increase fraudulent gun transactions and transactions on the black market. These problems could be rectified by stricter and uniform punishment of gun traffickers. Gun control opponents say banning assault rifles would be bad because there are legitimate uses for them. What legitimate uses do these things have? Uzis, AK-47s and MAC-lOs weren’t made to kill rabbits. And they’re overkill for home defense. They’re overkill period. Gun control opponents say restricting purchases and ownership infringes on their rights, including their rights to protect themselves. That, however, is not the real reason most of them are concerned. As Alan Farnham wrote in Fortune, “The average gun store patron owns three handguns, two rifles and two shotguns. Anyone filling this description isn’t buying out of practical need. Nor is he Don Knotts, terrified of burglars. He liken guns — for their own sake and for the pleasure they provide.” And then there’s the famous “Guns don’t kill people. People kill people.” If that’s the case, then don’t give people guns. After 23 people were killed by gunfire in Killeen, Texas, last week, the issue of stricter gun enforcement is once again thrust into the national spotlight. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizens of the United States the right to bear arms for both home protection and for the advancement of a national militia. It was the sucess of this national militia that contributed to victory in both the Revolutionary War and the Mexican-American War. Currently, there are more than 200 million firearms in the United States, discounting the police and the military. These weapons are owned by as many as 70 million Americans. Handguns caused an average of 8,000 deaths per year between 1985 and 1989. Gun-related deaths cause about 30,000 deaths every year. Government studies say guns are used in one-fourth of the most violent crimes. In England, where gun control is strictly enforced, there is a high rate of death by firearms. With possible legislation such as the Brady Bill (to put a waiting period on the sale of handguns) being considered in Washington D. C., the firearm debate will continue. In the Tuesday, October 22 issue of Mustang Daily, the campus library information phone number was not correct on the opinion page The correct number is 756-2598 In the same Issue, Public Safety Director Richard Brug's name was not spelled correctly Mustang Daily apologizes for the errors The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states, “A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” At the time this was written ‘militia’ referred to every able-bodied man. U.S. Code, Title 10, section 31 states that the militia of each state includes “all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and...under 45...” In 1788, John Adams argued that “anns in the hands of citizens may be used at individual discretion.” Gun control has no direct relation to crime rates. The four nations with the highest per capita gun ownership have some of the lowest crime rates (Switzerland, Israel, Denmark, and Finland). Britain has very restrictive gun control laws, however between 1960-75 their homicide rate doubled. Between 1930-75 the U.S. rate only rose 30 percent. In Jamaica, ownership of a single bullet is punishable by life in prison, however in 1980 Jamaica had 6 times as many gun deaths as Washington, D.C.(one of the most violent U.S. cities per capita). Gun registration is useless. In 1968 the Supreme Court ruled that criminals couldn’t be compelled to register their weapons because to do so would infringe on their Fifth Amendment right against selfincrimination! A 1985 Justice Department study showed that only 21 percent of felons’ handguns were obtained through retail channels. The millions of dollars and thousands of man hours used for background checks would be better spent prosecuting and punishing those responsible for 80 percent of our crime problem — career criminals. The FBI states \"murder is primarily a societal problem over which law enforcement has little or no control.” This problem exists independently of firearms. Assuming all firearms could be removed from society, crime would still continue. Gun control laws affect only law abiding citizens. They are the only ones that will obey them. If a criminal used a gun in a drive-by shooting, would he be likely to worry about such a minor law as illegal possession of a firearm? I hardly think so. Firearms do not create violence. It is a permanent part of society. To remove a person’s ability to defend against violence is a moral outrage. Every human has the right to self-preservation and for some that defense is a firearm. No other means of defense is as effective. Proponents of gun control would like you to believe that cops in general are for gun control. WRONG! The National Sheriffs’ Association states, “There is no valid evidence whatsoever to indicate that depriving law-abiding American citizens of the right to own arms would in any way lessen crime or criminal activity.” The National Police Officers’ Association of America: “We feel that an American citizen of voting age and good character should have the right to purchase without restriction a handgun, pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, or like item without interference by a government body.” Patrick Henry said, “The great object is that every man be armed ... Everyone who is able may have a gun.” It is obvious that our Founding Fathers knew the value of personal, unrestricted gun ownership. Without it there would be no United States. The Second Amendment gives an explicit right for firearm ownership by private citizens. Even ignoring that right, the societal gains of private ownership far outweigh the costs. With or without firearms the insane will continue to disrupt our society. There is no way to eliminate them. Jack the Ripper and Jeffrey Dahmer are two prime examples. Fourteen people died in the Oakland Hills fire. If a match started it, should we ban matches? Effective enforcement of gun bans is impossible. Irrational fears will not stop criminals from prejang on society. However, gun control will certainly stop honest citizens from defending themselves from dishonest, armed criminals. Gun control is harmful only to the honest. When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. SHERRY L. GURTLER/Mustang Daily “Riding these horses strengthens a person’s character...and it changes a person forever,” Roger Hunt (pictured above) said. Jeff Miner (photo right) teaches Hoist the Hour to respond to signals and commands. she graduated from Cal Poly’s Thoroughbred Enterprise Program two years ago. The filly won her first race last year, earning over $17,000. The Enterprise students has seen her name in the Daily Racing Form more than once. The Thoroughbred Enterprise Program was introduced to Cal Poly in 1941. The California Thoroughbred Breeders Association initiated the program with donations of brood mares and stallion services. Cal Poly students hand-raised these horses until they were ready for sale. In 1970, Poly went beyond breeding, and entered the training ring. The program began selling horses at the March Invitational Sale in Del Mar each March. Some horses currently in the program will sell for up to $15,000, Hunt said. “The program is unique to the West Coast,” said Hunt, who has been supervisor since 1978. “I haven’t heard of any other program like it anywhere.” Hunt said thoroughbred racing is one of the most dangerous and expensive sports in the world, but it is also one of the most rewarding. “Riding these horses strengthens a person’s character,” Hunt said. “And it changes a person forever.” Cal Poly’s Thoroughbred Enterprise Program has now sold more than 100 horses. Sixty-one of those have been winners on the West Coast, earning an lifetime average to date of $25,000. Altogether, Cal Poly’s Thoroughbreds have earned a total of $1,529,893 at the track. There are seven students involved in this year’s program, and three 18-month-old Thoroughbreds. The students accepted into the program must complete a series of classes, know how to ride and have a career goal in the horse industry. “Our number one goal is to help these students become better horsepeople,” Hunt said. “It doesn’t matter what type of horse they ride or what event, but these kids are going to learn something about themselves. Just like the horses learn.” Kimberly Loeb, an animal science junior, plans on working in equine veterinary medicine. specifically in leg care. She hopes her year with the Thoroughbred Program will give her a head start in her career. “We are as inexperienced as they (the horses) are,” Loeb said. “It’s hard to get two beginners to come together and learn something, but we’re doing it.” Tbday, Loeb is working with Decko, a temperamental colt who seems anxious to get out of the bam. “We’re lucky,” Loeb said as she brushed clean Decko’s back. “He’s acting very good right now.” Loeb is looking forward to March, and the Thoroughbred sales in Del Mar. “I’m the type of person who gets attached to animals,” Loeb said. “But I’ll be very proud of him (Decko) if he makes it to the track. I will have really helped accomplish something.” Animal science senior Amy Weston agreed. “This is an opportunity I might not get anywhere else,” she said. Hunt said many of the students meet important contacts at the track. racism in American culture and cultural heritage) will not increase drastically with the creation of this new position. He hopes Gish will be able to identify new funding sources so that professors will have the time and resources available to develop new courses. “There is a significant number of professors interested in teaching and research in this area,” he said. Those teachers aren’t just in the School of Liberal Arts. Ribeau said engineering, agriculture and business professors have expressed interest as well. The fact that Gish is from out of state does not worry Ribeau. California has a different school system, and Gish will have to learn it quickly. Although he said this could be a disadvantage, Ribeau wasn’t overly worried about Gish adjusting to the change. On the positive side, having someone come in from outside the system could also be an advantage, Ribeau said. “He hasn’t been jaded and beaten down by bureaucracy and paperwork,” he said. “He has an optimistic view.” His first quarter here, Gish will focus on his administrative duties. After settling in, Gish will teach in the English department beginning with a modern novel course this spring. that this attitude is part of the problem. “Something has got to change,” states SLO Police Chief Jim Gardiner. He believes it is going to come down to “peer responsibility.” Yes, it is true that only 2 percent of the students are causing the bulk of the problems. Yet, it is the others — the ones standing around just letting these events happen — who are also at fault. “Peer pressure” is a much stronger defense against these disruptions then anything the police force can put together. ASI Community Relations Coordinator Marc Fowler suggests that students “take an active role in helping stifle such events before they get started.” Get to know your neighbors. Tell them when you are planning a party, and, by all means, don’t let the party get out of hand. “Police yourselves,” Fowler continues, “Have some respect for your neighbors.” ASI is putting a lot of effort into improving the relationship between the students and the community. Events such as Neighborh(X)d Cooperation Week are put on so the rifl between students and the community can be mended. ASI is not condemning parties or drinking. We are condemning the disrespect some of our students have for the community and the police department. Please, be part of the solution, not part of the problem. “The industry is supportive of us, and they’re really interested in it (the program),” Hunt said. “Obviously someone is interested, they are buying our horses. And the exposure and education is good for our students.” Jeff Miner, an animal science junior, is looking forward to riding on the track. “It’s a different style of riding,” Miner said as he saddled up a second colt. Hoist the Hour. “But it’s all horsemanship and the more experience you get, the better you will be.” “Horses are a luxury,” he added with a smile. “If I can make a living with them, that wouldn’t be too bad.” Hoist the Hour was “feeling good” this morning as Miner let him run in the training ring. The colt kicked at a metal wall and the sound echoed through the quiet morning air. Hunt stood by the ring and kept a watchful eye on his two new students. T^is was the second week the horses had felt a person’s weight on their backs. “We aren’t breaking these horses,” Hunt said. “You break a match stick ... you educate a horse.” Down below the training ring lies a 3/4 mile race track, built in 1984 by the Oak tree Racing Association. It won’t be long before these three young horses will get the chance to test their speed. Hunt said. Jeff Miner wraps the legs of his trainee, Hoist the Hour, in preparation for morning workout. Enterprise Program. She showed up this morning to watch the new hopefuls. “This really becomes your passion,” said Johnston, who rode at Del Mar track last year. “Y>u just want to go faster and faster. There is nothing like it (horse racing). It’s almost addictive.”",
