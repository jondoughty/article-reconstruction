Black Canyon. “Okay,\" aays the gray-haired, tigfatfaced ranger, “I arant you people down there and in the river quiddy. I don’t e-have time to atay with you all morning.^ Down there and in the river, fast.\" He turns to his car. “Sieg haU,’’ I say in my head and exchange “Wall, nah-nafa to him, too” glances with arith my fellow trip members. Half the group salutes this back of the ranger’s head as he climbs in his car. * Wa are in the water with such speed and efficiency even I am impressed. No rookies, us. We’re with ASI Outings. We know a canoe when we See one, no problem. Some of us know how to steer one. too. The ranger scowls from the road. Soon everyone is in the water and we turn downriver, we have miles to -•» before we sleep. Wa get three hundred-yards. I can still see where we put in upriver, but natural bot springs are hiu^ to pass up. \"A showering waterfall of 100 degress Fahrenhait, poob in the rocks, and rain caves where drops of hot and cold water come from the ceiling along stalactites. We find an old water tunnel drilled for the dam that struck hot water of its own. Inside is a sauna, tepid water flowing from the end of the tunnel a hundred feet back. Hot springs, a sauna and a cool lagoon. I can tell some people are get- Scenes from the river. ThrM canoM, riggad with a plastic tarp for a sail, oruisa across Lake Mtic^ava.

Tlus is my first dawn outdoors in years, up before the sun. We sit. <m f rock and watch the sunrise. There are no pretensions, either by us or the land. Thaw are no lush ferns or carpeting moss, no towering redwoods to block the mountains for the trees. Just hard rock, shards of gravsL cactqs. sage.

Mich. |AP) - A judge in northern Michigan has taken an unusual approach in a divorce case, giving tfarse adolescent bi^s custody of their parents’ house whils the mother and father altar-nate month-long visits.\t—— ' Grand Traverse Cemnty Circuit Judge Charles M. Forster granted a divorce on Jan. 6 to Allan and Cheryl Church of Interlochen. a community of 4,000 peopfo 16 miles from IVaverae City. Iheir children—David. 15, Dcmakl, 13 and Dale, 11—remain at home, while th^ parents move in and out and pay the bills. Mrs. Church, a 37-3rear-old secretary who is spending'this month with the children, daacribed the judge’s settlamant as “a good third option for people who are getting a divorce.” “'This way no one loses.” she said. The three children sD say they ars happy about the dedsiem. “When my dad tpld ms about it, I couldn’t believe it.” Dcmald said. “I thought my ma would get us. I’m glad one of the parents wasn’t left out.” “The Idds love it.” said Church, a 42-3rear-old dectri-cian, who is spendhig this nxmth at his parents’ home after 17 years of marriage. “They (the children) don’t have to change schools or change friends, and they can come and visit ms after sclmoL” The residence is a few doors away fnmi the home of ^ the father’s parents and only a mOe or so away from where the nwther’s parents live. Forster said his decision was “natural” because both parents testified that the other was a good parent and said the children loved each other. This Irttor ia in regard to the article printed on Thnraday. Jan. 14. “Minoritiaa Copa with Poly.\" I found the artide to be atatisticaQy informative. However, I alao found Um information praaantad to ba Umitod bacanaa racial, aodal or educational iaaoea • waren’t daah with in dapth. It waa my underatanding that tha intention of the article waa to anMghton the misedncatod Cel Poly atudent body regarding problama in human ralationa—iocaHy and internationally. Tha probiemi which people of color deal with at Poly are “peannts” coci^Muwd with those faced ou a dobal perapective; for azamide, the failure of Uw worid to recognize the African culture aa the father of human civilization. A local example of this ignorance ia the Greek Pratomity/Sorority system, which waa stolen from the Ancient African Mystery System. In fact, the Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato and friends were students of the indigenous African Mystery System, from which the Greeks wrote Western philosophies about echication and human relations. What Western cultures accept as Philosophy—cams from the African Mystery SyMam. The Muêtang DaOy artide deale superficially with racial laenes by only quoting an unimportant inchiiuit I deacribed caauaOy during tha interview. Hie points not mantioned, which I amphasized, are to me much more dgnifi-eant and earious. To overlook more complex local and International-iaaoea ia to continue to deny their existencs. It’s difficult to deny that a child bom on the continent of India or Africa is Uksly to die of starvation befoiwits fifth birthday. To deny the existence of this problem Is the same as pouring poison into the swollen belly of a starving infant. - We, the Omega Pai Phi Frstsmity, feel our obligation is to speak to thsss concerns and not allow ourselves or this community to live pleasantly amidst this blatant ignorance. We must destroy the blinders which obëcurs our global vision. The artide reduced world problème to mm local incidents. Our concerns extend much farther.",
