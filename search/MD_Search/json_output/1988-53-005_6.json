    "article_text": "Editor — Who is Dan Quayle? The uproar over his use of family influence to avoid military service in Vietnam is obscuring other defects in his background. Quayle's close friends and family acknowledge his glaring lack of intellectual ability. Theodore Bendall, Quayles’s family attorney, recently said if he could change the Indiana senator he would “increase his I.Q. He is not an intellect.” Quayle’s father freely admits that his son’s main interest in school was “broads and booze.” Dan Quayle’s mediocre academic standing in high school apparently prevented him from applying to major universities. Instead he went to little DePauw University where his grandfather was a member of the board of trustees and a major contributor. In college Quayle had a reputation for being a poor student, frequently drinking to excess, and dating many women. A former professor says Quayle received mostly C’s and he got a D in at least one course in his major, political science. His good looks and nonintellectual image led some classmates to nickname him derisively as “face man.”",
