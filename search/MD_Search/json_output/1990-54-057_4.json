    "article_text": "While I might not like Martin Luther King Jr. for his values or infidelities, I do like what he represented as a symbol. King is not alone in his infidelities and hidden beliefs. Thomas Jefferson was unfaithful to his wife; when he died, he left his estate to one of his slaves, his mistress. Abraham Lincoln wasnâ€™t perfect; while giving his Emancipation Proclamation, he was smuggling slaves to a secret island. I could go on, but it is not my point to batter American immortals. King was not as perfect as we might think, but he was not alone either. These men all did great things for America and stupid, hypocritical, immoral acts in their private lives.",
