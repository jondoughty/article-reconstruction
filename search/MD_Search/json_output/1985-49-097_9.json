    "article_text": "AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) - Jack Nicklaus had reached the 15th green in the first round of the Masters golf tournament when he casually glanced up at the leader board. There, staring back at him from ” line of red digits that trans.ated\" into sub^par holes, were a couple of new ñames — Inman and Randolph. John Inman and Sam Randolph are amateurs, rookies who played the prestigious Augusta National layout Thursday as if it were some ordinary public course. Forget the* history and, tradition. Forget the lightning fast greens and the foreboding three-hole cluster called Amen Corner. Forget the legions of veterans who have been devoured by this challenging course. Here were two kids, one barely out of college the other stiU an undergraduate, shooting 2-under par 70s that left them two shots off the opening round lead. And Jack Nicklaus, five-time winner of the Masters who finished the first round one stroke behind them, loved it. * 'T thought, ‘If this isn’t a shot in the arm for amateur golf,’ ” he ,said. “I’m tickled for them. Maybe' this will put some life back into amateur golf.\" Nicklaus was aware of Inman, whose brother, Joe, is a tour regular. The youngster went to school at the University of North Carolina with Nicklaus’ son before graduating last December. Randolph,' however, was a mvsterv. \"What’s his first name?” Nicklaus asked. “Where’s he from? How’d he get here?\" Many years ago, he had played Augusta as an amateur. Did he think a non-pro could really win this demanding event? “It would have to be a college kid who’s been playing constant, competitive golf,” he said. “Inman’s an outstanding player. I’d be delighted to see him stay up and play well. But for an amateur to win, he’s got his work cut out for him.” Ig the flush of his fancy first-round, Inman, 22, could see himself slipping into that green jacket on Sunday. Really. \"I wouldn’t rule it out,” he said. “If I can control my emotions, my game, sure, I could win-it.” ‘I’m tickled for them. Maybe this wi^l put some life back amateur golf./ BOSTON (API - The Boston Marathon, plagued by controversy and beset by’a lack of quality runners, will be held for the 89th time Monday with defending champion Geoff Smith and Lisa Larsen Weidenbach as the favorites. -The world's oldest marathon was rocked by two controversies in recent days. Mark Plaatjes, 24, a medical student in Johannesburg, South Africa, had been entered and given a prestigious front-row position although his country is barred from international track and field competition because of its apartheid race policy. But the Athletics Congress, the national governing body for the . sport, upheld a rule established by the International Amateur Athletic Association, the world governing organization for track and field, that forbids South Africans from in international meets. Then came the disclosure that the runner who was to line up alongside Plaatjes, a 33-year-old Carlos Godoy from Colombia, had submitted an incorrect qualifying time on his entry blank. The 6-foot-l Hearns has a 3' inch height advantage and a 3-inch reach advantage. Neither edge is outstanding. Hearns did upset Hagler at' the final prefight news, conferene»\" when he said. “I've been fighting men and now I'm going up against a midget.\" \"You're just a freak, snapped Hagler. \"When I get into the ring I 'm a giant.\" 9 foot daaks w/4 larga drawers 825, up-holstarad chairs 810 - 815, lamps from 810, padded headboards w/attached nightstands from 815.
