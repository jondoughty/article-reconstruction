    "article_text": "The Cal Poly Rugby Club defeated Loyola Marymount 46-3 to break a three-year dry spell and remain undefeated on the season at 2-0. With the score just 12-3 at the half, the Mustang forwards adjusted to the Lion attack to re- tain possession for the Cal Poly backs. Hooker Blain Flickner explained, “The first half score let us know that we weren’t working as a cohesive unit.” The second half was all Cal Poly’s as the Mustang’s produced 34 points, won 22 of 32 line outs and 14 of 33 scrums. Good hustle and determination defined the ruggers efforts. Steve Davies, Bob Silverthorne and Chad Humphreys all scored on 50-yard runs. Randy Croyts said “the revenge factor cannot be overlooked. After our faisco last year we owed them a payback, a win like this is very satisfying.” The ruggers try to remain undefeated this weekend when they play the UCLA Bruins at Biddle Park near Lopez Lake at I p.m.",
