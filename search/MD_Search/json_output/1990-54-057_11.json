    "article_text": "The Poly Royal board is planning to divert our attention from drinking to educational activities. downtown stores be kept open at night during that weekend. •The Foundation and the university gave money to the Poly Royal Committee to make a high-quality brochure in order to increase positive public relations about the weekend. •At a committee of statewide university representatives, a request will be made to change the image of Poly Royal through press releases in their college and local newspapers. •The Committee is working with apartment complex managers in an effort to regulate parties and prevent riots. The committee is not trying to stop parties, but downplay them, said Hublou. “We are trying to gradually stop it so that it doesn’t get so big that it has to be canceled,” said Hublou. As concession booths increase, the amount of educational displays decrease. To change this, all 300 concession booths will receive a 5 percent discount on the university’s portion of profit if they set up an exhibit explaining the purpose of their organization. “The key to preventing the problem from perpetuating is really in the attitiudes of the students,” said Hublou. “If they don’t take pride in their school, their clubs, and hence. Poly Royal, we can talk until we’re blue in the face and it won’t do any good. The clubs need to take pride in themselves and put their best foot forward.”",
