    "article_text": "Because an increasing number of Cal Poly students and faculty members are improperly displaying their parking permits, the Public Safety Department will soon be Pining violators. Beginning April 14, parking officers will issue S3 citations to vehicles on which permits have been improperly placed. This comes after years of not enforcing university parking regulations as stated in the Cal Poly Handbook of Parking Rules, said Cindy Campbell, Public Safety parking officer.\t. ates mere instnimental in helping with the design. Rod Levin, a 1938 graduate and George Stewart, a 1973 graduate, are also owners of the firm along with BBI Maul. They, along with MacIntyre, have taught at Cal Poly in recem years. The project arill take an estimated 18 months to flnith aad will requko the Venture Architects Arm as consultants until h is complesed. The project, which has been designed to fit in with the unique Cal Poly look, will also be a amatelpiece for some former Cal Poly students. “For nqrseif, being a student there aad havtaig done some of the work on it was exciting for me.** said Schulae. “And what 1 fed that I've done by working on the project is 'team by doing,’ which is the motto of Cal Poly.” Six students are running for the position; Kevin Fox, Tyler Hammond, Mike Hogan, Steve Johnson, David Kaminskas and Kevin Swanson. Both students and administrators expressed that an increased awareness and concern about student government has had an impact on the amount of interest in the election. “The participation in the election is a tion of how productive has been this year, and students want to get involved,” said Tyler Hammond, presidential candidate. Roger Conway, director of the University Union, said people are realizing ASI is a student corporation for the benefit of students. ASI servica and programs control S3 million a year. “Legaily, they (presidents) have responsibilities that most people don’t have until they tuve been out of school for 10 years,” he said. Stan Van VIeck, a candidate for ASI vice president, believa the number of students running for president wiU encourage the student body to become involv- ed. “Eviery vote will make a difference, especially in this year’s election,” he said. ' Because so many people are running tor office, Kaminskas, a presidential candidate, anticipates a run-off. The problem with having a run-off el^on is students assume a candidate wili win because be had the most votes in the first round. StudenU fail to vote in the run-off election, resulting in poor student representation, Kaininskas said. The six candidates will talk about student issues on KCPR radio from 7 to 9 p.m. Tuesday. Listener phone calls will be taken on the air. Great Peace March to cross Nevada border Tuesday despite rain CAL NEVA. Calif.

The Director of Business Affairs for Cal Poly had his tide changed to Vice President for Businas Affairs April 1 as part of President Warren J. Baker’s restructuring of his suff. . Jim Landreth. who held the position for almost 15 years, will ■i. have the same job duties. He has five distinctive areas .of responsibility which include campus fiscal operations, budget planning and administration, planning and support services, public safety and the business and plant operations functions of housing and conference services. “I am pleased that the presi-I ^ dent has seen fit to changf; my title,” said Landreth, who has ~ been working at the Cal Polys, here and in Pomona, for almost 30 years. In a memorandum to his top staff members, Baker wrote: \"With the title change for Landreth, I note the restructufing of the administration of the university and I also recognize the exemplary job that (he) has done in a vital role.” There will now be four vice presidents directly accounUble to Baker: the vice president for academic affairs, who will also act as senior vice president, the vice president for information systenu, the vice president for university relations and Lan-dreth’s position. probably seemed an appropriate time to recognize the function that Landreth has been performing all of this time,” West said. LandrOh said his title change, along with the restructuring of Baker’s suff, was prompted by a new CSU system policy. “It’s now a trend in the CSU for people in my position and with my responsibUities to have this title.” The CSU system was structured for years by a unique policy that only allowed for two vice presidents per university. Traditionally there was always a vice president of academic affairs, said Landreth. About two years ago the CSU implemented a nunagement personnel plan as a byproduct of collective bargaining., Those persons that held madagemem or supervisory level positions were exempt from collective bargaining. With the new^ policy, presidents were given more flexibility to change job titles and assignments. “The real impact occurred at the vice president level,” said Landreth. Three other administrators work under the general direction of Baker, and won’t have title changes: Jan Pieper, director of personnel and employee relations; Russ Brown, dean of stu-denu; and Douglas Ocrard, executive dean of facilities administration. Gunman’s brother may be of help in hostage situation EULESS, Texas (AP) , — A two-day-old sundoff cotatinued Sunday between police and an armed man holding his ex-wife hostage in a convenience store, but a brother of the guiunan was allowed to enter the store in an effort to end the impasse.

He allegedly shot and wounded a policeman who answered a silent alarm at the store. themselves spending an increasingly longer amount of time \"searching on our hands and knees for the permits.” Such permit searches not only coat parking officers valuable time, but in turn cost the Public Safety Department more money, she said. The only correct placement for perihanently affixed parking pcrmiu is on the right rear bumper Of the vehicle, according to the official rules. The Parking Handbook also specifics that a floating parking permit — one that is detMhable ~ may be issued to an individiul who Is In a car pool or owns and registers more than one vehicle to a single permit. A floating permit can also be used if the vehicle bumper design will not accommodate afflxing the permit, specifically if there' is no bumper or if it’s wooden, cor-rigated, painted, Fiberglas,,. plastic or rubber, said Campbell. Floating permits must be hung from the rearview mirror or from a flipped-down sun visor, with the writing on the permit facing toward the back of the vehicle, according to the handbook. Daily or weekly parking permits can only be legally be placed face up in the center of the dashboard. CiUtiolis will be issued if any out-of-date parking permiu have not been removed from vehicle bumpers after they have expired, the rules stipulate. Individuals who receive fines for any of the above parking permit violations will have 14 days to appeal the ciution or pay the fine, s^ Campbell. If the violation errors are corrected in that 14-day period and the vehicle is Uken to the Public Safety Department to prove that, the citation will be voided, stesaid.
