    "article_text": "and on the market is Simplesse, from the NutraSweet Company. It is a “natural” product made from milk and/or egg white protein, in a process called microparticulation. The mixture is heated and blended to form tiny bubbles of protein which have the creamy, rich texture of fat, Thday Simplesse can be found in some frozen desserts, and it is awaiting approval for use in a variety of other foods. Simplesse reduces the fat content of foods because the fat is replaced by protein. However, it is not calorie-free. For example, i/‘2 cup of regular ice cream has 130 calories and t/2 cup of an ice cream made with Simplesse has 120 calories. This shows the importance of reading labels when choosing foods to include in your diet. Fat substitutes in foods may be helpful in reducing the total fat content of our diet, but we should not rely on them alone to give us better health.
