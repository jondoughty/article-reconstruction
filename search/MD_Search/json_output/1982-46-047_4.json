    "article_text": "A proposed music major is currently being reviewed by the Curriculum Committee of the Academic Senate and may be instituted as part of the campus curriculum, according to the head of Poly’s Music Department. Bessie Swanson said that although the proposal was made only last month, she hoped a major would be implemented because “it is valuable to the university.” A bachelor of arts degree would be offered if the major is adopted. \"The main rationale for a music major.\" said Swanson, is \"Cal Poly is a university. \"By definition, a university' is an institution of higher education where students, in addition to specialized studies in a particular professional field, should expect to enhance their preparation for life as educated persons, she said. \"The objective is achieved by participating as a member of a campus community that includes the intellectual, social and aesthetic elements of an educated society, as well as by enrolling in courses appropriate to the student s interest and ability ’ In order for the Music Department to keep up its quality group performances, students are needed who can devote a lot of time to their music, according to Swanson. \"This isn’t to say that students in other discipbnes can’t perform,” said Swanson. But she feels that a major in music would make it easier for students who are interested in music to perform with various campus groups. Because there is no music major, students who want to participate in the various performing groups on campus must do so along with their other classes. According to Swanson, this limits the quality of performances, because pressures in other classes keep students from fully pursuing their musical interests. “The cultural component of the campus needs to be developed, and can with a musk major on campus,” said Swanson. A major'in musk at Cal Poly is valuable because there is no school within a 100-mile radius where students in the area can get a degree in musk, said Swanson.",
