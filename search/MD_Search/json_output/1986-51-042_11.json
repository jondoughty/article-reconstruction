    "article_text": "Everyone knows that the Central Coast offers a great climate for sun-worshiping humans, but many may not realize that another organism benefits equally from the warming rays of the sun: the grape. The valleys and foothills surrounding San Luis Obispo provide a premier climate for raising certain wine grapes. Some 27 wineries in the immediate area and others throughout the state use Central Coast grapes to create a wide assortment of varietal wines. Joseph Montecalvo, food science and nutrition professor. said the combination of consistent warm days and cool nights is an ideal climate for certain types of grapes. “It’s a beautiful climate for the production of Zinfandels, Chardonnay, Cabernets, Pinot Noir,’’ he said. “All of these are very high quality that are produced here.’’ One of the most important aspects of a wine grape, according to Montecalvo and crop science professor Paul Fountain, is the balance between sugar and acid levels. A certain sugar content is necessary for proper fermentation of the wine, and acid level relates directly to the actual flavor of the wine.",
