    "article_text": "Gish said the fact that Cal Poly is the last school in the CSU system to implement an ethnic studies program should not be looked upon negatively. “Although Cal Poly has not moved as far as it should, at least it is moving forward now,” Gish said. “It’s important to accentuate the positive and move in that direction.” Along those lines, the next step, Gish said, will be to begin a program leading to a minor in ethnic studies and eventually work toward implementing a major. Gish also plans to create an Ethnic Studies Committee that will communicate between faculty, students and the administration. The problem with the ethnic studies program now is that it is not visible to most of Cal Poly’s students and faculty, Gish said. See ETHNIC STUDIES, page 3",
