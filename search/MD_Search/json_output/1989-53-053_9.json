This good feeling was carried over to the UU Pla/a, in spite of the drone of people on the fringe of the pla/a who were not interested. This brings my second impression. Perhaps they were unable to appreciate what was happening. Perhaps they failed to recogni/e the significance of Dr. King, or the importance of this exercise in humanity. Or, perhaps they lacked the fundamental ability to respect others and their views, some of which might just be new or different. If they had been quiet, they might have been enlightened a little.",
