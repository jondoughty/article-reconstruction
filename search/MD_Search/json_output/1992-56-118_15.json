Bill Clinton is governor of Arkansas. Immediately after her speech, Hillary Clinton was rushed off so she could keep on her schedule. Prom San Luis Obispo she went to South Central Los Angeles and spoke to community leaders. From L.A. she went to Sacramento, and from Sacramento she went to San Francisco in a single day. Alec Kohut, a member of Young Democrats at Cal Poly, said the students should not feel snubbed by Clinton because she did not speak with them. “I am into politics, and I understand her schedule,” Kohut said. “You don’t see Barbara Bush coming near SLO.
