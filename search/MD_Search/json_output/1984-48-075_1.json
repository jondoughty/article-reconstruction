    "article_text": "   The ASI Concert Committee is still without a facility in which to hold concerts, and the chance to sign performers to a concert at Cal Poly before June is slipping away.    The Concert Committee, a part of the ASI Program Board, has been without a facility to hold concerts since October when Jim Hailey, Physical Education department head, refused to allow any more concerts in the gymnasium until further guidelines of gymnasium procedures could be drawn up.                                                                                                                                  The Concert Committee chaired by Jerry Morales and Bailey along with Harry Busselen. the dean of the School of Human Development and Education, have up with guidelines acceptable to the thfoe of them, but are waiting for approval from the university’s Facility Use Committee.    The Facility Uae Committee la a standing committee chaired by Provost Tomlinson Fort, Jr. Its function is to interpret regulations concerning the use of campus facilities. The group only meets on call as issues arise, according to Morales.    Morales said he and the rest of the Concert Committee members have been waiting two weeks for the Facility Use Committee to make a general endorsement of the- new guidelines for concert procedures, and will probably wait another week while the members of the Facility Use Committee respond to a proposal Fort sent to each of the members.    If the committee members generally agree to the new guidelines, the Concert Committee can bid on performers for possible concerts on campus spring quarter, according to Morales.                 ,    The situation is frustrating for the 106-member Concert Committee because until the committee has a guaranteed facility to use, it cannot enter any contracts with a performing group, Morales said.    “We won’t even consider bidding, which means Concerts is at a standstill,’’ remarked Morales. \"It's very frustrating for the committee because we haven’t been able to do anything about concerts. As a result we’re going to lose out on a lot of acts.’’    Morales said the performers that are available before June have been finalizing their tour dates over the past two weeks. As a consequence. Cal Poly’s, chance of contracting one of these acts is getting slimmer as they wait for the Facility Uae Committee to makes decision.    A broken down press in University Graphics Systems prevented Tuesday’s Mustang Daily from being printed. For that reason, the Valentine's Day classified advertisements are being run today.
