Cash prizes ranging from $50 to $200 are awarded to the top three entries, and the winners piece will be published But, according to contest organizer Lynette Hamel, there’s a catch — each entry must begin ’vith the same sentence. Hamel said this year’s starter sentence is “The deal with a sweet one.” “The story that falls in between that first sentence and the last period,” Hamel said, “is up to you.”",
