    "article_text": "since its $200,000 deficit was reviewed in July 1993. Both Harrigan and ASI Vice President for Finance Shawn Reeves said the Children’s Center forecasting was flawed in assuming too high a number of students would be on campus paying ASI fees and putting their children in the daycare facility. Reeves said the basis of these problems, as well as others, was poor planning on ASI’s part. “When we made the financial projections (for the new Center), enrollment was higher at the Center and the university,” Reeves said. “Once the operational realities kind of set in, we realized that the Center’s enrollment goals were too high and that we were not going to meet it now or in the future.” The goal of ASI was to maintain the Center’s occupancy rate at 100 percent throughout the school year. Yet in July 1993 it was clear that the Center could not achieve that goal. “Last year our occupancy rate was fluctuating between 60 to 70 percent a quarter,” she said. “We now understand that our goal of 100 percent was unrealistic and are preparing a budget for next year that will allow See CHILDREN’S CENTER, page 5 In an effort to increase ethnic diversity in the College of Agriculture, Cal Poly announced in late April plans for an Equity Leadership Program to attract young minority students to careers in agriculture and natural resources management. The program was initiated in response to a proposal authored by Natural Resources Management Department Head Norman Pillsbury and natural resources management professor Richard Thompson. Their proposal described a need to attract potential leaders from a wider source of ethnic backgrounds. Thompson said national statistics from the U.S. Department of Education show an overall lack of minorities in programs related to agriculture and natural resources management. “Part of it comes from misleading images of what these careers involve,” Thompson said. “I’m convinced that several ethnic groups don’t believe there are ... professions to be had in these fields because they have bad images of them.” The program is the result of a joint partnership between Cal Poly, the Soil Conservation Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service, Together, they will provide the $100,000 needed to co- fund a liaison office and enact the program. The purpose of the program is to get a diverse population interested in agricultural and natural resource careers, according to Associate Dean of Agriculture Wally Mark. “There are a lot of stigmas about careers in agriculture and natural resources,” Mark said. “We have to overcome (them) in order for them to become interested.” Animal Science sophomore Antonio Gutierrez, president of Latinos in Agriculture, said certain stigmas exist in terms of what kind of agriculture-related jobs are available. “I think it’s because a lot of people. See EQUITY, page 5 On the quiet street of Balboa near Laguna Lake, Cal Poly students live next to a retired couple. But the two households’ occupants don’t like each other much, and Alvin and Norma Rogers say that’s because the students lack basic respect. Two blocks over, on Coral Court, a similar living arrangement exists. But Ed and Gladys Fraund say their student neighbors are considerate. The two stories are on opposite sides of a spectrum of student-neighbor relations in San Luis Obispo that ranges from civility to outright enmity. Many Cal Poly students live in homes in residential areas because they like the freedom from the rules that go along with dorm and apartment living. Usually, students can live harmoniously with the families in their neighborhood. But sometimes things go wrong. Some say this is because many students don’t realize that living in a home has its limitations too. The Laguna Lake area is a neighborhood that only in recent years has acquired many student residents. With the influx, it has become a cross-section of San Luis Obispo, characterizing the gamut of neighborhoods’ attitudes toward students and the students’ own attitudes toward neighborhoods. From page 2 Fostering resentment Alvin and Norma Rogers have lived in their family home on Balboa for nearly 30 years. Everything was fine until about five years ago when a Cal Poly student’s parents from the Bay Area purchased the home next door for their son to rent with his friends. At first the students living next door weren’t a problem. Then, the owners’ son moved out. Since then, it has been a matter of luck from quarter to quarter. The couple feels “most students are good, self-respecting people” and that they have had “some neat students next door.” But a few bad experiences, including their current situation, have made them averse to having students as neighbors. They said they have had problems with parties, noise, garbage, parking, unkempt yards, loud motorcycles and lights kept on all night. “If Cal Poly students continue to move into this area, we’ll be forced to move out,” said Norma Rogers. “And we don’t think that’s fair.” The two don’t entirely blame students for their situation, though. “It’s a combination of factors,” said Alvin Rogers. “It’s not just the students, it’s the out-of-town landlords. And the city, too.” The couple said if landlords cared about their property as more than just revenue, maybe their tenants would respect the property, too. They also said that the city should require landlords to maintain their rentals’ yards to avoid property devaluation. Much of the Rogers’ problem with students is that they don’t keep up their lawn. “The (grass) was four-feet high (recently),” said Norma Rogers. Their neighbors. Cal Poly students Randy Schultz, Gail Weaver, Buck Chow and Jason Curtis, agree:\tSince their landlord doesn’t care about the look of the property, they don’t either. “We can see where (our neigh- bors) are coming from,” Curtis said. “Since we don’t own the house, we have a different mentality (about caring for it).\" “The yard is our responsibility,” Schultz said. “But we didn’t have $200 to $300 for a lawnmower. And the one the landlord provided doesn’t work.” Last month, they borrowed some weed-eaters from friends and mowed the lawn. “We like it short, too, “ Curtis said. The students said they don’t dislike Alvin and Norma Rogers. “But we feel we were already on their s-----list before we intro- duced ourselves,” Weaver said. “I wanted to make a good relationship with our neighbors, but I feel that there’s no way we’ll ever win because we’re students.” Chow agreed. “If they would have asked us nicely instead of saying, ‘Hey, you’re students, and we know you don’t think about things,’ maybe we would try harder,” Chow said. But the Rogers feel they are reasonable because they didn’t approach the students with their concerns until there was a problem. Alvin and Norma Rogers feel that it’s the city’s responsibility to pass ordinances and enforce them. “The students need to made aware of the laws, too,” Norma Rogers said. “Maybe the city could publish handbooks for people living in single-family dwellings” which outline guidelines for cooperative and legal living, she said. Residents for Quality Neighborhoods has often lobbied the City Council to implement various restrictions in San Luis Obispo neighborhoods, often successfully. Its projects have ranged from overnight parking ordinances to restricting the number of people allowed to share a dwelling. “The people in RQN are not against students.” said RQN Co-Chair Tom Kay. “They’re against having their rights infringed upon.” He said the group realizes it’s a small percentage of the students that reinforce negative wanted to moke a good relationship with our neighbors, but I feel that there^s no way well ever win because we^re students.\" If Cal Poly’s Judicial Affairs office is going to continue legislating on free speech issues, it had better start taking them seriously. The Daily recently reported the punishments handed to several Cal Poly Marching Band members for their part in a raunchy newsletter that ridiculed several other students. For their offensive comments and drawings attacking fellow band members, the editors of the “Swinging Sousaphone” had to answer to the university’s administrative justice system — and we question the “justice” they’ve been dealt. The offending students, our aiiministration says, will remunerate their offenses by performing such trivial tasks as writing a two-page paper on what they learned from the incident and attend a seminar on gay and lesbian issues. in the Aug. 4 death of Thomas Hyde, 30, who suffered from the degenerative nerve disorder Lou Gehrig’s disease. By the time Kevorkian hooked Hyde up to a canister of carbon monoxide on a mattress in the back of his old, rusty van, Hyde could bare’y walk, talk or feed himself, Kevorkian, who had faced up to four years in prison and a $2,000 fine if convicted, acknowledged he supplied the carbon monoxide and placed the clear plastic mask over Hyde’s nose and mouth. Three jurors interviewed after the verdict cited a legal loophole and a technicality as reasons for acquittal. They concluded that Kevorkian’s main intent was to relieve Hyde’s suffering, not cause his death. Prosecutors had argued that part of the law was meant to apply to physicians prescribing experimental drugs for terminal patients. “We believe the intent was not to help Hyde commit suicide,\" juror Gwen Bryson said. “We believe it was to relieve pain and suffering.” the prosecution proved where the suicide took place. Kevorkian had initially told authorities the suicide took place in a Detroit park but testified at trial that it happened in the parking lot behind his apartment building in a different county. “I don’t think it’s our obligation to choose for someone else how much pain and suffering they should endure,” said juror Gail Donaldson. Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Timothy Kenny said he believes the evidence supported the charge, but “there were a lot of emotional hurdles to get over.” The verdict raises more questions about the future of Michigan’s assisted-suicide ban, which expires Nov. 25. Kevorkian’s five-day trial was the first time charges under the law had gone before a jury. His lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, said the verdict “drives a stake” into the ban’s heart. “This is the first chance for the people to decide,” Fieger said. “It wasn’t Dr. Kevorkian on trial here. It was everyone’s rights on trial hero,” especially Latinos, think they’re going to go out in the field and work,“ Gutierrez said. “A lot of their parents think they’d be better off as engineers. “Some parents don’t understand that you can get the same kind of jobs as an ag major.” Gutierrez added his club actively recruits high school students and encourages them to think about careers in agriculture. “I feel that the more you expose it to minorities, the more you will get,” Gutierrez said. According to a report published by the Institutional Studies Office in winter quarter, minorities make up 16 percent of the Natural Resources Management Department. In the College of Agriculture, 17 percent are minority students. Thompson said ethnic minorities statistically pursue an education in business, engineering or liberal arts. Many minority students, he said, do not realize the career opportunities in environmental and forestry consulting, such as with the U.S. Forest Service or the National Park Service. minority surrendered its privileges to the black majority. Both sides promised to forgive the past and build one nation. ANC officials stood before their new national flag and raised their glasses in a toast in honor of outgoing President de Klerk, incoming President Mandela and the “new South Africa.” “I stand before you filled with deep pride and joy — pride in the ordinary, humble people of this country,” said Mandela. “You have shown such a calm, patient determination to reclaim this country as your own. And joy that we can loudly proclaim from the rooftops — free at last!” Although ballot officials remained less than halfway through the counting, an ANC landslide was indisputable. With about 44 percent of the estimated 22.7 million votes counted, the ANC .had 62.6 percent to 23.7 percent for de Klerk’s National Party. The Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party was a distant third with 6.2 percent, followed by the proapartheid Freedom Front with 2.8 percent. The ANC was projected to win around 240 seats in the new 400-seat Parliament, which will select Mandela as president Friday. De Klerk’s concession speech was attended by about 300 people at National Party headquarters in Pretoria. “Next Tuesday I shall lay down my responsibilities as state president,” de Klerk said. “I shall be handing over the presidency to Mr. Mandela.” “Mr. Mandela has walked a long road and now stands at the top of the hill,” he said of the ANC leader, who spent 27 years in prison for opposing the policies imposed by de Klerk’s party. “I hold out my hand to Mr. Mandela in friendship and in cooperation.” De Klerk is expected to serve as one of two vice presidents. “During the past four years. we have proved that we can work together,” de Klerk said. “Our relationship has become a symbol of the ability of South Africans from widely different backgrounds to cooperate in the national interest.” De Klerk told The Associated Press that the National Party “will in due course become the biggest party in South Africa. “This was the freedom election, the next will be about economic policy. In the 1999 election, the National Party will be the winning party,” he said. De Klerk, 58, took office in 1989 and was expected to continue the hard-line policies of his predecessor, P.W. Botha. He shocked the world by announcing the imminent end of apartheid, and freed Mandela from a life prison term. Within months the two men had launched negotiations that led to a new constitution guaranteeing equal rights for blacks and whites, and clearing the way for all-race elections. us to meet our financial obligations.“ Reeves said ASI has based the Center’s 1994-95 budget projections around an 86 percent occupancy rate in hopes of balancing its loudget. “I think it’s something that is definitely attainable, but the Center will have to make this budget in order to make next year work.” 'The budget problem doesn’t just affect the Children’s Center. Because of the money the Center has lost, ASI has made cutbacks in other programs and has instituted a hiring freeze throughout the corporation. “ASI has left a couple of job positions vacant in order to help the Center meet this year’s budget,” Harrigan said. “This basically means that we haven’t hired any nonstudent staff since we found about the deficit.” According to Reeves, ASI has limited the funds given to the Program Board and Instructional Related Activities. “In order to save the Center, ASI has issued a moratorium of Program Board events in excess of $7,500,” he said. “We also were not able to grant an extra $20,000 to other ASI organizations such as the Cal Poly Crew or the MEChA club.” ASI isn’t the only one that’s had to sacrifice. Employees at the Center also have made several changes in efforts to ease the burden of the deficit. Children’s Center Director Haila Hafley said the Center is making drastic changes with assistance from employees, parents, ASI and other departments on campus. With help from Campus Dining and the Nutrition and Food Science departments, the Center has learned how to control food preparation costs. The Center also is making cutbacks within the organization. High staffing costs have been among the biggest contributors to the deficit, and the Center managers say they already are addressing those. “We have decided to eliminate one classroom and limit the amount of children per classroom in order to keep our child-teacher ratio low,” Hafley said. “We realize that some of our cutbacks are small, but every lit- problem is these careers are not typically viewed as science-based professions. “These are professions that require a solid science base, mathematical and statistical expertise and good public skills,” Pillsbury said. “People need to see role models working in these kinds of fields in a way that is realistic.” But Pillsbury said the program is not only for minorities. “It would be impossible to build leaders in an environment that is not representative of the real workplace where all ethnic groups are present,” he said. Pillsbury plans to use the 3,800-acre Swanton Pacific Ranch in Santa Cruz County as an integral part of the program. Cal Poly acquired the ranch from alumnus A1 Smith, who willed it to the school upon his death early in winter quarter. Pillsbury said the progi’am would use existing facilities. The students, he added, also would be able to use the land’s resources. In addition, he said the department is seeking funding to build new facilities. Pillsbury said the students also will visit Bureau of Land Management sites, soil conservation field stations and many forests and parks. But details still need to be worked out, according to Pillsbury and Thompson. Thompson said the program would probably create environmental camps for students in elementary school where they would learn how to take water quality measurements and how to identify various animal species. Older students would probably participate in internships, Thompson said. Regardless of exactly how the program will be designed, both Pillsbury and Thompson agree it will teach students about careers in agriculture and natural resources. “There is none quite like this program,” Pillsbury said. “There are a number of programs that are nature camps, but this one is focused on careers. Right from the very beginning, they are going to see that they can be this professional person out there helping to make decisions.” tie bit helps,” she added. “These changes will alter the Center in some ways, but we are determined to provide the high quality care we always have.” According to Hafley, the Center also has made cuts in personnel areas that would least effect the program. These cutbacks include a small decrease in student starting pay along with limited pay increases. The Center also has eliminated one office manager position in hopes of decreasing all unnecessary costs. “In conjunction with these changes we have increased parent fees by a minimal amount,” Hafley said. “And we now are recruiting volunteers to help in classrooms, kitchen and office areas in hopes to reduce student staff hours.\" Agricultural science senior Jennifer Raia said as an employee of the Center she feels the program is too important to lose and supports all the changes. “We don’t have as much as we did before, but we need to save the Center because it has too many wonderful things to offer the children, parents, students, and the university,” she said.",
