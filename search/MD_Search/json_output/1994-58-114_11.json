    "article_text": "Cal Poly men’s and women’s track and field joined 21 other schools from California and Nevada in one of the largest meets in California last Saturday. The Mustangs traveled to UCLA to join other four-year universities from a mixture of divisions as all were allowed to compete in the first ever California-Nevada Men’s and Women’s 'Track and Field Collegiate Championships. The meet came as a preview to the Nationals, where nine Mustangs have qualified to this date. “We were competing against individuals going to Division I Nationals to run against some of the best athletes in the nation,” Head Coach Terry Crawford said. With the tough competition, Cal Poly gave a good showing as the men’s team finished 10th and the women’s team took ninth. “I thought overall it was a good meet,” Crawford said. “It was not a 100 percent good performance by the team. Some people faltered a little bit, but we had a solid representation in the finals (Sunday).” Many of the athletes turned in seasonal bests. During Saturday’s qualifying rounds, senior Dan Held topped his season’s best in the 800-meter with a time of 1:50.79. Teammate and fellow senior Coley Candaele did the same in the 1,500-meter, as he surpassed his season’s best by .5 seconds with a time of 3:49.1. Candaele went on to take third in the finals the following day. Sophomore Chris Bane beat his top performance of the season by .75 inches when he jumped over the 6-6.75 mark in the high jump to give him a tie for first place Saturday. He finished ninth in Sunday’s finals with the same heighth. After a tough start, placing fifth in the prelims, junior Andrew Hill gave one of the best shows for Cal Poly. He took first place in the triple jump during the finals Sunday. “Saturday was a really otT day, and I felt pretty lucky to qualify for the finals,” Hill said. “I wasn’t feeling good with the approach. It was a real fast track, so the next day I got out there early to See TRACK & FIELD, page 7",
