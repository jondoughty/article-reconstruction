    "article_text": "About 20 members of the Young Democrats turned out at Osos Street’s Rose and Crown while the College Republicans gathered in the University Union lounge to cheer their respective candidates in last night’s presidential debate. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Vice President George Bush faced off in the televised debate Sunday night. “We’re very serious ... about knowing what’s going on,’’ said Shara Peters, Young Democrats president and cofounder. The Democratic Central Committee of San Luis Obispo sponsored the event at Rose and Crown to “make people aware of the issues,’’ said Tom Ferraro, president of the DCC. The mostly partisan crowd watched the screen closely, though the waitresses were kept running by a few who seemed to have come chiefly for the beer and food. Applause for Dukakis broke out early as he lambasted Bush’s participation in the Reagan administration’s dealings with Panamanian President’Manuel Noriega. Bush’s rebuttal that the CIA could find no proof of Noriega’s wrongdoing was met with scattered grumblings and hisses. As a result, Ferraro said, “Bush never quite recover^. I think Dukakis rattled Bush. Dukakis came across as more of a leader.’’ Cal Poly student Brendan Martin agreed. “Bush seemed to stumble ... teemed unorganized,’’ he said.",
