    "article_text": "Editor — Rarely do we have occasion to read the Daily twice before washing the windows with it. The Jan. 10 edition was an exception. Chris Thomas’ column “A dream is just a dream” required quite some thought and this response. Thomas clearly is an eloquent and intelligent person, and a good writer. Under the presumption of discussing Dr. King, he discusses integration as an escape from blackness, and a sign of insanity. He follows this with a call for action to create an My coffee mug says Save the Males. Once upon a time, men roamed the earth and dominated the world, and it was good (for the men). And the world turned. The women evolved, and the men dealt with it. It was survival of the fittest during the 21st century. Those who couldn’t deal were dealt out. We have legends about radical feminist and chauvinist groups who waged war in our 21st century, creating the coldest cold war ever known to man. Extremists polarized our people. They hacked and whacked at the world, stubbornly in the name of humanity. Meanwhile, a society of spectators let their television sets tell the story. Back then, couch potatoes had been planted everywhere. The world spun upside-down, and people lived inside-out. Nobody liked it, but nobody talked about it, either. The 21st century, later referred to by sociologists as the Human Ice Age, was a human stalemate, because the men and women couldn’t live together. According to the legend, only frostbitten emotions, icy stares, and cold words were cultivated. (Like a snowstorm from hell, it’s hard to imagine.) But all that is ancient history, and we have a better understanding of each other, here and now, in the 22nd century. We’re thawed-out, although some tales are still told ... There were a few radical feminist groups back then, like the F.F. (Fascist Feminists), the Sex-tremists, and the Manhandicrs, all too revolutionary for the general public. But this was Free America, and they spoke out. A snowball fight was inevitable, but no one cared. One chauvinist extremist group, the Sons of Bitches, went too far. In 2026, during International Women’s Week, some S.O.B. suggested a Men’s W'eek. There were riots. Even in San Luis Obispo people got out of control. The Cal Poly F.F. chapter claimed that every week was Men’s Week, and therefore a Men’s Week was unnecessary. But the Cal Poly Sons of Bitches protested, and they forced a Men’s Week upon the academic community. So no one shaved, and the dining hall served meat and potatoes for seven days. That’s how it all started. The rest is recorded in the history books. We look back at the 2020s and the 2030s, and we laugh at our great, great-grandparents.",
