    "article_text": "bachev, “Everything that has happened in Eastern Europe these last few years would be impossible without the pope and without the important role, including the political role, he played on the world stage.” More recently the pope has energized Vatican diplomats to exert formidable pressure on two United Nations conferences, on population and development in Cairo,.Egypt, and on women in Beijing. For months now, the most polyglot pope ever to evangelize in Peter’s footsteps has been studying Chinese in order to deliver his address in all the major languages used in conducting daily business at the U.N. Away from the seats of power and the crowded bleacher seats, the shepherd from Rome will ■pend some time with the powerless and the unempowered. He will have a casserole lunch with the homeless at a soup kitchen in Baltimore jvist down the block from the nation’s oldest Catholic cathedral. At Newark’s Sacred Heart cathedral he will greet more than 120 cloistered nuns, some going out of their convents for the first time since taking their vows a half century ago. “Excitement has been running high here since the day his visit was announced,” Sister Mary Martin, prioress of the Dominican monastery of Our Lady of the Rosary in Summit, NJ., said in an interview on the eve of the pope’s arrival.",
