    "article_text": "Baker didn’t need the ASI President to “resign” his elected right, since it was only a Cal Poly tradition. It was just taken away. Yes, graduation does expose the university to the community, but that doesn’t take away that graduation is mainly for students. If Baker wants a graduating student with a good academic record to speak, add one to the program. Yes, graduation is long, but a much higher percentage of the ceremony is taken up by non-students speaking than students. The representatives from various school councils have suggested the ASI president speak if that person is graduating. If Baker wants to add one of the academic winners from one of the seven schools, there is always room for another student speaker. President Baker, talk to students about changes. Commencement, after all, is for us, not you. We want the ASI president to speak at graduation.",
