When asked what effect the loss of Berryman would have on the team, Walsh said, “hopefully it won’t greatly effect the team, but when you lose your number one player, you have to work that much harder.” Berryman may be injured, but he is still there for the team. “He’s like an assistant coach, the players respect his opinion,” Walsh said. Another player Platt expects to lead the team is Tim Fresenius, who was ranked 11th in a preseason poll. When asked what his goal for the team was, Fresenius replied, “to get to the Nationals and win it! It will be tougher this year, the teams are better and we don’t have Neal (Berryman), but we can do it.” The team is focused on the championships but they know that it is too early to look ahead. “We have a tough conference, and many of the teams we play are extremely talented,” Platt said. Platt sees a three-way battle between Cal Poly, UC Riverside, and Chapman College for control of CCAA. “These teams can be beat, but it will take a strong team effort to win,” Platt said. On Jan. 28, the team will get a chance to prove they are deserving of their number two preseason ranking when they travel to Arizona State to open their season. “When you play a Pac 10 school, you’re in for a tough match,” Platt said, referring to Arizona State. The team’s first home match is scheduled Feb. 2, when Cal Poly hosts Westmont College.",
