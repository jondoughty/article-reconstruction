    "article_text": "Recent rainstorms caused minimal damage to crops and flelds on campus and at Cal Poly’s Chorro Creek Ranch. That’s how Gary Ketcham, general fann superintendent for the School of Agriculture, sized up the situation Wednesday. On the main campus, the rain did nothing but good, Ketcham said. The rain washed salts out of the ground, and water percolated down into the underground system, he said. At the Chorro Creek Ranch near Cuesta College, the creek broke through its boundaries for the third time since 1971, Ketcham said. The errant creek washed out a culvert bridge crossing, sending the section oi culvert pipe 200 yards up a field toward Hollister Peak. Water flowed through parts of several fields and created at least one sink hole where an old stand pip>e was mounted on a concrete base. The actual location where the creek jumped the bank has not been determined yet, Ketcham said. By the time equipment and labor costs have been added up, it could cost almost $10,000 to repair the damage. “You take care of the things you can, but if Chorro Creek is going to run, it’s going to run,” he said. More than 11 inches of rain fell in the area between Feb. 8 and Feb. 15, Ketcham said. After the first rain, all the hay crops absorbed the water and germinated. That first rain allowed the rangeland grass to take root and be a value to the cattle. “The rangeland is coming back real nice,” he said. “Any more rain we get will be a plus.” The rains created only minor problems for crops raised on campus. “We were actually pretty well prepared for it,” said James Greil, a crop science professor. “Even though it was really muddy, we harvested cauliflower.” The broccoflower crop was affected by lack of oxygen due to waterlogged soil. “This is the first time I’ve seen such waterlogged conditions,” Greil said. The crop is salvageable, but quality will be lower, Greil said. Because broccoflower is in such large demand in the market, it will still sell, he said. Almonds are blooming in the orchard, Greil said. If rain comes during a full bloom, fungicide will need to be sprayed, he said. “We have some mildew showing up on broccoli now, but it won’t be affected if the weather stays sunny and warm,” Greil said.",
