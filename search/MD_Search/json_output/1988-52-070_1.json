    "article_text": "Beginners and experts got together Saturday at the annual Adventure Day to participate in three military-type exercises. The day of events, sponsored by the military science department, included a beginning rappelling course, an orienteering competition and a biathalon (a two-mile run combined with a marksmanship tournament). Rich Steel, officer in charge of Adventure Day, said, “Our mission today is to train our cadets, recruit new cadets and create an Interface with the rest of campus and the public ... to maintain good relations with everyone and have fun in military kinds of events, also related to civilians.” Organizations holding charity fund-raisers in the University Union will always have to pay a surcharge to ASI if a senator’s bill passes through the Student Senate. Senator Andy Herrick’s Bill 88-02 requires a 10 percent charge for all such organizations. As the rule stands now, according to Resolution 86-28, organizations holding charity fund-raisers in the U.U. can defer the surcharge — 10 percent of their total profit — if they petition the senate and the senate approves. The 10 percent charged to all fund-raisers is put into the Campus Improvement Fund and is the only source of income for it and the student planning commission. The commission reviews and donates money to student and faculty projects that beautify the campus. Apparently, more and m.ore organizations who have charity fund-raisers have been petitioning to have the surcharge waived, draining the commission’s resources. This issue was raised because last week Lambda Chi Alpha petitioned to get back the $400 surcharge it paid for its Thrash-a-Thon. The senate approved the request, reducing the commission’s account to $2,000. Herrick doesn’t agree with waiving the surcharge. But he has nothing against charities. “I think the student planning commission was overlooked in Resolution 86-28,” said Herrick, chairman of the commission. “Approximately 75 percent of all fund-raisers (held in the U.U.) are charitable,” he said. And if they all asked for their surcharge back, he said, the commission’s resources would be depleted. School of Engineering Senator Kyle Shepard, also on the commission, agrees with Herrick. “It’s vital for the bill to pass in order for the commission to continue at Cal Poly,” Shepard said. “Without the bill, we won’t have a funding source.” Herrick said another problem with Resolution 86-28 is it left the word “charitable” completely open to interpretation. This required the senate to interpret each petition, he said, and that takes a lot of the senate’s time. His bill would define the word as “a group or organization outside Cal Poly and ASI that’s non-profit and recognized (by the list of official charities in the Student Life and Activities office) to be serving their benefactor directly.” Bill 88-02 would put a $200 maximum limit to be paid per See CHARITY, page 4 Dirty politics. Once again we must deal with the disgrace of politicians who resort to personal attacks to fight their political battles. An example is the latest round of verbal fisticuffs between candidates George Bush and Robert Dole. Both Republicans, their personal attacks achieve only the destruction of respect for themselves and their political party in the public eye. Sure, politics is a stressful business in which success is difficult to gauge most of the time. A little victory in the headlines after an insulting exchange may give a feeling of success and reward. This unfortunate aspect of politics only proves that the current batch of individuals is so inept at political understanding that they cannot hold logical debate on the issues. Instead, to liven up the action for television, they attempt to degrade each other like kids on the playground. A case can be made that these attacks actually give insight to the true political animal that the public may never see. But political decisions must be based on hard facts, not the vengeful tactics of a candidate with a bad attitude. Is it also a reflection of the public’s apathy? Maybe the candidates would rather issue personal attacks because they know the public really doesn’t care or know anything about the issues. A public trained on soap operas is quickly bored to tears by politics. Why not liven things up and take a lesson from the soaps by attacking character flaws? It sure makes headlines and it sure gets people talking. At its roots this childlike insult trading destroys the political process. It diverts attention from the issues and trivializes the world’s most important political event. I am writing about the recent approval by the County Board of Supervisors for on- and offshore oil manufacturing. I am a primary source, that is, I speak from my own first-hand experience with oil drilling off and on the coast of Santa Barbara and Ventura. These oil companies have been, and remain to be, notorious for misleading the public and downright lying to them. I lived in Santa Barbara and Goleta for nearly 16 years. I moved to San Luis Obispo permanently one year ago. I am a tar refugee. When I first moved to Santa Barbara in 1971, the beaches were surrounded by beautiful white cliffs and rocks. You could swim in the water and the tar was hardly noticeable — just small flecks here and there. Then we had an oil slick (my first of several), in which many types of marine life were sacrificed. Volunteers cleaned it off the beaches, not the oil company, who was at fault. They did not even clean it out of the water this first time! Of course, the oil company managed to keep that quiet and at a later date, claimed they had participated in the slick cleanup. But that is not true. I was there. Volunteers had to try and wash off birds and baby seals that were paralyzed by the oil and tar. Still the majority died. Does anyone care? It does not seem so in Santa Barbara, where money talks and values walk. Did you know that the United States only produces 2 percent of the oil it consumes? Nowadays in the Santa Barbara and Ventura area you cannot walk along the beach without wearing your “tar” shoes or “beach” shoes because you will get a new sole on them every time (made of tar). There are very few rocks and cliffs along the beach that remain white — most are black with tar coating. Almost every bathing suit and pair of shorts I own have tar/oil stains because you cannot avoid it there. 1 have been trying to escape it, but now they want to start here. Before you know it, there will be no clean coastline left. I watched the oil/tar problem progressively and steadily increase in the water, and on the beaches, in direct proportion with the increase in oil platforms built. Basically, it comes down to oil company money. As we have seen over the past decade plus, a good part of government is corrupt. And the root of the corruption, most often, is money. So these two go together, hand in hand, each feeding the other. Did you know that the government very suddenly attempted to disban the Coastal Commission? It is one of the only public check systems we have in our favor against the oil companies ruining our coast. Remember when two tankers collided at Point Conception a few months ago? It took three days before it was admitted that one carried oil and there was no mention of the condition of marine life that was involved. Just because we use a resource does not mean we need to abuse it. This attitude of taking all you can get without regard for your future and your childrens’ futures really scares me today. I look forward to our generation moving forward and showing the country we can find other ways to make petrol or petrol substitutes. We can eliminate greed and bring forth caring, concern and respect for our planet and its limited resources. Take an active step and vote if you can. I would like to praise the Mustang Daily for its openness to preseat all sides of an issue. The position of the Daily is to inform and stimulate its readers to think. The abortion cartoon last week was one such occasion. On Friday Ms. Trumbull wrote a letter blasting the Daily for printing the cartoon. She missed the very object of the cartoon, which is to stimulate thought. Just because of an unplanned pregnancy you don’t need to forego your goals. Many pregnant mothers and mothers with children attend Poly. To someone irresponsible enough to have sex unprotected, raising a child must seem an insurmountable task. The loss of a child by adoption is a hardship many mothers have to deal with. But 1 think it’s comforting to know your child is being cared for by someone who loves and wants it. The thought of your child lying dead in a garbage can behind some doctor’s office has little comfort. The way you lose a child says a lot about how you feel about the loss. Think about the opposing view. What about a child’s right to control its body? If you don’t agree, at least the cartoon caused you to think about it. Chumash Auditorium.

As you know, anthe-maniacs like myself just go crazy around flowers. So what does my Valentine send me on Valentines Day? The FTD* Lov/e Note Bouquet! Well, let me tell you, when I saw those beautiful flowers in that fine porcelain bowl It drove me wild. Besides, this glorious bouquet also came with a note pad and pencil with which I’ve written my Valentine every day. And smart Valentines know it doesn’t cost much to send us anthemaniacs Into this flower frenzy. Just ask your florist to have n\"D send one for you. Berrett said “the student who is trying to save a few bucks by stealing a parking permit or buying one from some guy in the parking lot stands to lose a lot more.” Any car found displaying a permit that has been reported stolen will be towed at the owner’s expense. A citation for possessing stolen property will be issued to the person under whose name the car is registered. And the matter will go to the courts, where fines average $200. But how can a parking officer spot a stolen permit amid the thousands of cars parked on campus? Easy, says Berrett. “They recognize the cars out there,” he said. ‘‘Between themselves they can talk about cars that they’re having trouble with.” Campbell said, “We look for distinguishing marks. Let’s say it has a Mustang Village parking permit and then it has a staff permit. We’re probably gonna wonder why ... so we’ll do some checking into that.” It’s usually the “floater” permits, those that hang from a rearview mirror, that get stolen, Campbell said. If a stolen permit is spotted “on the bumper, there’s usually a story behind it: somebody’s reported it stolen and given it to a friend.” In January, more than half of the police reports filed were for stolen permits. The 21 thefts reported last month bring the total of stolen permits still outstanding to 93. The police record resulting from a petty theft arrest can be more costly than the fines levied, Berrett said. “A record can follow you,” especially someone hoping to work one day for a company that requires a security clearance, he said. Troubled that college students would be so petty as to steal parking permits, Berrett said “People need to look a little more toward the future.” charity fund-raiser. Non-charity fund-raisers would pay the full 10 percent, even if the amount is more than $200. The senate will discuss the issue for two weeks, and then vote on it. The commission’s latest project is putting an entrance sign, like the ones on Grand Avenue and Highland Drive, on the California Boulevard entrance. It Barbara scored a 170.45 for second place and Southern Utah State had 161.0. “This is the best score we have had all year,” said Cal Poly head coach Tim Rivera. points. She tied Kriss Miller of San Jose for first place on the balance beam with a 9.05. Wells tied for second in the floor exercise (9.05) and the vault (9.0). She also placed third in the uneven bars with an 8.65. Mimi Phene, ranked 20th nationally, was fourth in the overall with 35.35. points. She won the vault with a 9.4, good for a new school record. She also tied for first in the uneven bars with a score of 8.9. Phene did not place on the balance beam or the floor exercise. The crowd was disappointed when Phene successfully completed a double back flip in her floor routine and only received an 8.5. Chris Kotzbach of Santa Barbara placed second in the all-around with 35.65 points, followed by Miller with 35.4. Kotzbach won the floor exercise with a 9.25 and Miller tied for first on the uneven bars and balance beam. Kimm Zernik, a Cal Poly sophomore, injured her knee in the beginning of her floor exercise and was unable to complete the routine. Zernik is one of several Lady Mustangs to be injured this year. Wendy Meyer said when a teammate was injured in the past, the Lady Mustangs had a tendency to give up. But they have learned how unproductive that can be. “We’re not giving up anymore, no matter what happens,” she said. The Lady Mustangs will travel north Friday to compete at San Jose State on Friday. They will then compete in the Chico State Jamboree Invitational on Saturday. “That is everything,” said Or-rock. “It’s what we’ve been working on.” Although Cal Poly appeared to be the aggressors, the Highlanders threatened to take the lead several times in the first half. However, their efforts were only marginally successful. Riverside shot often, but couldn’t sink the shots. As a result. Cal Poly ended the half ahead, 39-31. The second half witnessed a mild comeback by the Highlanders, but more missed shots and a rash of steals by the Lady Mustangs confirmed the win. Cal Poly accumulated 10 steals to Riverside’s three.",
