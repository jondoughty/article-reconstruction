It’s difficult to get as strong a nucleus of experienced ballplayers together as we Included in that number is shortstop Craig Gerber (.322) \"who performed at a high level of consistency as he has all year,” Harr said, and left fielder Eric Peyton (.329), who went 6-for-9 in Saturday’s double header against Chapman. \"And let’s give Mark Bersano a big pat on the back, too,\" the coach added, for'his four-hit shutout against the Panthers Friday and pitching as well as he did Sunday against the Toros. Bersano was 7-2 and a 2.30 ERA. \"The season went pretty much as anticipated,\" said Harr. “We had a good team and a good year in a tough league. The CCAA is kind of an unknown Pacific 10.
