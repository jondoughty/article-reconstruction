They have beaten the teams that beat us pretty badly.” Top-seeded Northern Florida matches up against eighth-seeded Northern Colorado. The winner of that contest advances to play the winner between fourth-seeded Grand Canyon and fifth-seeded Pace University (NY.). The winner of the match between third-seeded Cal Poly Pomona and sixth-seeded Air Force faces the winner of the Mustangs vs. Aggies contest. “It would be nice to ruin their (the Aggies’) year,” Eppright The Mustangs will have to do without the services of freshman Gina Chelli. Eppright is suspending her for three matches for violating team rules. He would not elaborate on the infraction. Junijr Alissa Bailey will move from her usual sixth spot to the fifth court in Chelli’s absence. Sophomore Emily Schuch will fill in for Bailey. The Mustangs also qualified their normal starting lineup for the NCAA singles and doubles tournaments. Nationals begin Friday and continue through Thursday, May 12. His effort paid off as he jumped 50-4.5, a personal record and enough to qualify for Nationals. “That’s the kind of effort you hope for — individuals rising to the competition,” Crawford said.. “If we would have gotten that kind of effort throughout, we would have done spectacular.” The women’s team showed just as well as the men’s, with many members qualifying for the finals of the meet. DaMberations on a National Tournament invitation policy has been hovering like a hatchet over Cal Poly women’s tennis during the team’s season, at times threatening to sever the Mustangs chances of a playoff berth. But those dangers evaporated Sunday when Tennis Head Coach Chris Eppright received a call from an NCAA official saying the Mustangs would be permitted to compete in their seventh consecutive Nationals. Eppright said he and his team were not sure they would receive an invitation to the eight-team tournament hosted by Cal Poly Pomona. He had his doubts because he did not know if the NCAA was going to allow four teams from the West Region into the tournament. The NCAA invites the top team in each of the four regions and then offers four at-large bids. In the past the NCAA has limited the number of teams it invited from a single region. So, despite the Mustangs being ranked sixth in the nation, there was a chance the NCAA might overlook them in favor of balancing the tournament with less representatives from the West. The NCAA eventually decided to allow four teams from the West including Cal Poly, UC-Davis, Cal Poly Pomona and Grand Canyon University (Ariz.). In their first contest, the seventh-seeded Mustangs face defending champions UC-Davis. The Friday contest is a rematch of last year’s finals, which the Aggies won 5-1. The teams’ opener in the tournament marks the first time the two rivals clash this year — an early season match was rained out. “For us, the draw (to play UC-Davis) was not bad,” Eppright said. “UC-Davis got the worst draw. We match up against UC-Davis better than any other team. “They (the Aggies) are the See TENNIS, page 7",
