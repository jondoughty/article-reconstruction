    "article_text": "The election results were presented by Dan Nail, director from the School of Agriculture and chairman of the Elections Committee. He said that the committee had investigated all filed complaints. Nail said the use of telephones and solicitation of residence halls were not brought to his attention in time for him to prevent them, and now those incidents are the responsibility of the university. Dennis Lang, director from the School of Business, was worried about the election count. “If anybody put in a fake social security number or a fake name, we have done nothing to check to see if those names are actually students,” he said. The board included a request that the university check all names and social security numbers to make sure the students were registered. Some directors felt rushed in their decision on the issue and pleaded for more time. Others pushed to approve the election. “By postponing (approval of) the election, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the See ASI, page 12 Students who are planning on leaving valuables at their ofT-campus San Luis Obispo residences during the quarter break may as well just kiss them goodbye, says a l(K’al police ofTlcer. Every year when Cal Poly students leave for the holidays, a large number of student residences are burglarized, said Steven Seybold, crime prevention coordinator at the San Luis Obispo Police Department. “It has become a major problem, especially in student housing,” Seybold said. “When everyone comes back, we get a flood of reports (that students have been burglarized).” Seybold said 138 thefts were reported by residents of off-campus student housing after last year’s holiday season. He also said that there were probably a large number of students who were burglarized and did not report the crimes. Cal Poly Public Safety Investigator Mike Kennedy said the situation is different on campus. “Most of our crime happens while students are still here,” Kennedy said. He said housing hires security guards that patrol the residence halls every night during the break. “We (Public Safety) also patrol housing. “It (burglary) is not a big problem during that time.” Did you know Jesus Christ was a Capricorn with Sagittarian tendencies? He was reportedly bom on Dec. 25, which puts him at the beginning of Capricorn, but close to the end of Sagittarius. Rumor has it that he was actually born in August, and he is really a Leo. But I like to think he was a Capricorn. That same rumor says that they chose Dec. 25 as his birthday because it would make for a nice convenient holiday in the middle of winter. I don’t believe it, though, because I am a Capricorn born the day after Christmas and, well, it’s comforting to know that Jesus had a rotten birthday too. For those Christmas babies out there, you know what I am talking about! It is a special curse that is beset on us from the instant we are delivered. Your birthday is inconsequential compared to Christmas. You want presents, well too bad. No one can remember your birthday and even if they could they wouldn’t be able to afford it. “What do you need birthday presents for, you’ve got Christmas presents?” I get that all the time. Or they say, “This is your Christmas and birthday committee selects the finalists the following quarter. During winter quarter, the nominations are narrowed down to approximately nine finalists. The committee then visits class-rcKim sessions of each finalist to determine three winners. “Each member of the committee will visit a (finalist’s) class-i(K)m, but they won’t know we are coming,” said Calvin Wilvert, committee member from the social sciences department. Wilvert received the distinguished teachers award for the 1986-87 school year. The winners are announced during spring quarter. Last year the committee selected five winners, two more than the unusual number. “The standard number of winners is three,” Greenwald said. “Last year the committee had a difficult time separating the The award committee consists of five faculty members and two students. Nomination forms will be available in all classroom buildings and both the library and University Union information desks until the last day of the quarter. They can be turned into either the U.U. or library information desk. A thousand needy San Luis Obispo children are hoping to receive Christmas gifts this year from community members participating in the Secret Santa Program. The progi’am, started by the Salvation Ai*my, helps people in the community below the poverty level and families with special hardships. “It’s a really nice way that people can help needy children in the community,” said Salvation Army Captain Noreen French. She said that the program begins with needy people applying for Christmas gifts including food and toys. The children’s first names then are written on a tag to be placed on a tree in the community. Community members anonymously pick a tag off the tree and buy one of the gifts listed on the back of the tag. “The person who buys the gift can buy whatever gift they want to,” French said. The gift does not have to be on the child’s wish The participants then bring their gift back to the tree and volunteers make sure the gifts get to the children at Christmas. “It’s worked very well in the past couple of years,” French said. “That’s why we’re so overwhelmed with applicants this year.” Last year the Salvation Army served about 600 needy families. “This year we’re up to 1,000, and we’ve had to turn some away because of it,” French said. “W’e are hoping that the community will be responsive to the needs.” Last year, there were children left who did not get their names picked off the tree, French said. The Salvation Army provided those children with gifts donated by local businesses, individuals and college students. “This year, since we’ve taken so many more (children) and the economy is so bad, there may be a number on the tree that won’t be provided for,” French said. French said two trees would be set up this year — one at the Central Coast Plaza and another at Network Mall. Names can be taken from the trees seven days a week from the day after Thanksgiving to Dec. 16. All gifts must be turned in by the 16th in order to make the deliveries. Business Improvement Administrator Association Lynn Block said that there has been a lot of positive response from the community. “It takes 100 volunteers to man the tree. We can always use volunteers to help with delivery and organizing,” Block said. “There’s so many kids that need help and there’s tons of names on the tree,” she said. “You can make someone’s Christmas by being a Secret Santa.” French said that by contributing to the program, participants can get discounts from many local stores. The program has been a tradition with the Salvation Army since 1982. This is the third year San Luis Obispo has participated. “I’m really happy about it,” Keller said. “It makes the team motivated to see that we’re ranked and people notice us.” Team captain and physical education junior P.J. Madigan is in his third year on the men’s team. He said he felt last year’s performance in the national championship, particularly some fast relays, helped them to get the No. 3 rating. “I was surprised. I expected us to be up there, but I thought UC Davis would be ahead of us,” said Madigan. “It really gives us something to shoot for.” Team captain and reci'eation administration junior Anne Oberg was also surprised with the ranking, released Nov. 25. “All along I’ve been told that this year’s team is the best we’ve ever had, but it was hard to see that because of the referendum,” Oberg said. Oberg said the referendum kept many good people from competing in the meets. She explained that if people swam in one meet and the referendum did not pass, they would lose their eligibility. But she seemed more concerned about Pan Am workers than her own predicament. “I feel bad. 1 really feel bad,” she said. “I’m originally from India, and we always flew Pan Am. It’s been in this country for so long. It’s like history.” The shutdown stranded thousands of passengers around the country, including 100 people removed from a flight to the Dominican Republic just before takeoff from New York’s Kennedy Airport. Several airlines said they would honor Pan Am tickets. But finding comparable flights during the busy holiday season is going to be difficult for many, said John Lindsey, a Pan A.m vice president. “Obviously,” he said, “it’s going to be tight.” “We’re all in shock,” he added. “It’s very, very tough for a 64-year-old airline and all the people who have gone through this.” M.any employees left jobless north of San Francisco and down tlie coast as far south as BajiT California, Leong said. “The theory is that they tend to escape the (weather) extremes of the central states,” Leong said. “Certain areas, I think, are like a funnel due to wind pat- terns or whatever. It is my theory that when they hit the coast they tend to look for areas to cluster.” Leong said the butterflies tend to gather in little groves, and this is one of the heaviest See Bl.T l KRFLIKS, page 12 were transferring to Miami from other cities as part of an plan to transfoiTn the cairier into a smaller airline ftK’using on Latin America. That plan fell apart on Tuesday. Pilot Terry Barnes got the news when he radioed from the air for tlie gate numbers of connecting flights. He was told there wouldn’t be any connecting flights. Harry Tomisaka, a 23-year fleet service veteran from San Francisco, walked into work Wednesday — payday — and found he no longer had a job. “We came up to work and they just told us we couldn’t go in,” he said. Pan Am became the third U.S. airline to die this year, after Eastern and Midway, amid deep industrywide troubles brought on by the Gulf War and the recession. Pan Am bookings also were crippled by the 1988 terrorist bombing of Hight 103 over Scotland. areas for migrating monarchs. Leong said about 300,000 of the colorful insects will spend the winter in the trees along Highway 1, enjoying their protection and the mild climate. “The ones born in the winter have a life span of about seven months. They will spend their winter here. Then, as they head north in the spring, they lay eggs along the way and die. “The progeny will emerge, mate, lay eggs and leapfrog their way north, generation after generation.” Leong said the summer butterflies live only a month or two. The ongoing studies include measurements of wind velocity, relative humidity and temperature at ground level as compared to those at the height of the clustered Monarchs in the trees. Using a telescopic aluminum pole with monitoring devices attached at the top, researchers can reach up to the level of the tightly-grouped butterflies. Identical devices record the same information at ground level. Leong and his students then enter the readings into a portable computer. Leong said this data should help determine why butterflies group at certain levels on the trees. Also, Leong calculates the height of the clusters to find the range of the groups on the trees. Leong said biological sciences professor Dennis Frey, also involved in the studies, catches and tags specimens in the Pismo trees. So far, over 1,000 butterflies have been marked. They are painted in one cell of the black, skeleton-like framework of the wings. “The tagging is twofold,” Leong said. “One is to see the behavior of the butterflies, to see if they stay here or move to another area. And since we have a coding system, we can tell, for instance, whether males cluster higher than females and how they distribute themselves.” Trails through the tall eucalyptus trees provide visitors with a look at the specimens. Orange County resident Mark Adler and his family made a point of stopping to see the butterfly trees. “It’s amazing to see so many in one place,” he said. “I thought they hung around backyards all the time.”",
