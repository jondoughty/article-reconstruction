Another corporate-sponsored event was the spring quarter ASI film series, which was underwritten by General Motors. “General Motors got a plug on the promotional material,” said Higgins, “and they got a day to display some of their cars in the University Union.” Higgins said the biggest problem with corporate sponsorships is that ASI must avoid competing with the university for funds. “The administration is concerned if we’re soliciting businesses that aren’t our business",
