    "article_text": "People auditioning for a play is a common occurrence, but goats auditioning for a play is quite a different story. Such was the case at a goat audition Saturday for the Cal Poly production of “Teahouse of the August Moon.” Two goats, Millie and Tillie, along with their owner, Joan Hanley, showed up to audition for the play. The goats did not appear nervous as they cavorted about before showing off for the director of- the play, Roger Kenvin. However, it quickly became a matter of sibling rivalry when the two goats tried to outdo each other for the coveted spot. In one of the scenes in the play, the goat is supposed to jump onto a jeep. To recreate that scene, the goats were to jump onto a table. Unfortunately, the goats had other ideas. While their owner tried to coax them with some eucalyptus branches, and Kenvin bribed them with readings from Shakespeare, the goats were not impressed. Only after Kenvin put the Shakespeare book away did Tillie show that she could jump on the table. Not to be outdone, Millie followed suit. nTT-ITTTITTT r-. -\tT",
