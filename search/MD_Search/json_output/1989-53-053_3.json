    "article_text": "San Luis Obispo city planners are asking Cal Poly and Cuesta College students to help them find an answer to the student housing crunch. The city is trying to increase housing for students as well as for families in its General Plan update, said City Planner Gary Price Thursday at the Student/ Community Liaison Committee meeting. But the planners must know what students want in order to provide housing. “It seems that students prefer single-family houses away from campus,” Price said. But other city residents prefer that students seek single-family houses close to campus or multiple-family housing downtown, he said.",
