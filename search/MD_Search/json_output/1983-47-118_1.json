    "article_text": "Calculators and mechanical pencils are sharing space lately with literary masterpieces in the backpacks of some Cal Poly engineering majors. They are men and women with technical majors going for something extra in the English department minor program. Approximately one-third of the 65 English minors at Cal Poly are engineering majors, according to Michael Orth, coordinator and advisor for the year-old program. Sometimes the load of 27 additional units costs those students an extra quarter or two, but for a variety of reasons they feel the investment of time and effort is worth it. classes are a refreshing change.” Then, too, there is the potential career leverage the minor might give an engineering major. \"The English minor may also give students more flexibility in their profession,\" said Orth. \"TTiere is a problem with illiteracy in business and industry. There is room for people who can write a report or make sense of what others may have written.\" Robert Valpey, Dean of the School of Engineering and Technology, agrees with Orth. \"In any and every business. including engineering, the need for communication skills stands out as absolutely essential for advancing in one's career,\" said Valpey. \"Where an English minor may aid in honing those communiction skills, then it is indeed a valuable thing to have,\" he said. includes Shakespeare, American and Victorian literature, advanced composition and English grammar. ' The program, which started winter quarter of 1982, is drawing about 20 sign-ups each quarter, but Orth said he’d be happy to see 200 more in the program. At least three of the engineering majors see the career benefits and the change of pace from their major as reasons for minor-ing in English. Roger Hand, a senior Electronic Engineering major said he became aware of the minor program through posters in the English building. \"1 looked at the classes 1 would have to take, and found out I would have taken most of them out of interest anyway. If I wasn't interested in English in the first place, I Students eating habits cause many problems for the library, the director of the Robert E. Kennedy Library said. David Walch said crumbs left by snacking students attract silverfish: small wingless insects. If students mix food into books while studying, silverfish may move into the books and generate, he said. This requires expensive fumigation to correct. Libraries take many steps to preserve their collections such as a controlled climate. Walch said food mixed in with books multiplies the problem of deterioration. Library furniture also falls victim to student dining. Students often spill coffee and other drinks on the couches and carpet in the library, Walch said. He said students also stick chewing gum under table tops and in cracks between couch cushions. Students eating while studying abuse library books outside of the library as well. Walch said the worst case of food stains he has seen at Cal Poly was a book which had been returned laced with ketchup. Students have gone far in breaking library rules against consuming food there. One student ordered a pizza and had it delivered to the library, he said. — Walch said students tend to eat in the library more in the evening, but eating starts in the morning with cups of coffee brought into the building. Students can solve the problems of food damage to library facilities best by doing their eating outside of the library, Walch said. prinMd harain «oMy lOf lnlonn«tion«l pupoM* Such pftniing ii no< lo ba con-ttnioC •• on oipraiMd or impIMd on-dorsomont or mitication ol lucn cam-morcial vonlurm by iKt JournaHim Dopanmoni of CoUlomia Poiytochnic SMM Univofslly.

All of 4ham are partic^mnta of Week of Welcome, or WOW. touted as one of the largest and moat successful university orientation programs to the western United States. ConnoUy is the WOW. board chairman. \"This year has been the biggest turnout I have ever seen,\" he said. Indeed, the auditorium is packed with perky people, the cavernous room filled with noise. The program has thrived for 11 years with the help of volunteer students. They are led by a WOW Boanl which works most of the year. This year’s board is Timbo Beauchamp. Dab-Iria Foa. Bill Kawaguchi. Mike Ovandon and Bob Schott. Of course, their reapon-sibility is organising the WOW counselors, but that doesn't mean they can’t let everyone have fim whils they’re at it. Every meeting has a diffsrant theme of drees. 0ns night the students had to dnas accordingto a WOW group symbol. Tersas Smith’s s)rmbol was \"screaming Yellow 2tonker.\" This week all will dress as cdsbrities. Then there is the serious stuff, discussions and lac-turan on such subjects as communications, stresa reduction, how to look beyond first impresskma and how to deal with handicapped students involved to WOW.
