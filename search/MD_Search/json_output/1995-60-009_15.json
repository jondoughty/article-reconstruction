    "article_text": "SACRAMENTO — Gov. PeU Wilson, responding to the acquit-tal of O.J. Simpson, said Tuesday that live television coverage of California criminal trials should be banned. The Republican governor also demanded that lawyers be barred from delivering political messages in their final arguments, and said he would ask the state Judicial Council to draw up his proposed rule changes. Most states allow some form of television coverage of criminal trials. *I would urge the removal of cameras from our courtrooms,” Wilson said at a Capitol briefing. ”We have survived the Simpson trial, but there is no reason to be forced to suffer through the theatrics of another ‘trial of the century' in this lifetime,” Wilson said. \"Turning a serious legal proceeding into a circus-like atmosphere is not in the interests of justice or public confidence in the justice system,” Wilson said, adding that television permits *the possible abuse of the process that certainly carries a risk to its integrity.” Wilson declined to talk about the verdict, but his comments suggested he was not pleased with the lengthy trial, which ended Tuesday with Simpson being acquitted of the June 1994 double murder of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. The governor said it was “particularly distressing” when lawyers “ask jurors to use a verdict as a means of sending a political message to law enforcement.” He was apparently referring to defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr.'s closing argiunents in which he urged jurors to combat racism and deception in the Los Angeles Pblice Department by acquitting Simpson. California’s top parole official, the chairman of the Board of Prison Harms, suggested that highly paid lawyers can have an undue impact on verdicts. “I would say that very aggressive and competent attorneys do know how to utilize and or ex- > ploit the nuances of law,” said chairman Jim Nielsen, who heads the panel that decides parole dates for prisoners sentenced to life. The 15-member Judicial Council is headed by the state chief jiutice. It serves as the administrative arm of California’s courts and sets procedural rules. Among other things, the council determines the use of cameras in California courtrooms. In 1984, it adopted rules allowing live courtroom television coverage. Prior to that, audio recordings and still photography were allowed, according to the governor’s office. It was uncertain whether the council has the authority to adopt rules governing the kinds of closing-argument changes Wilson seeks. The Republican governor said California should adopt coiulroom rules similar to those already in effect for federal courts, which preclude live television or audio coverage, and bar cameras and recorders from courthouse corridors. LOS ANGELES — The U.S. Forest Service has laid off hundreds of seasonal firefighters at the height of Southern California's fire season, leaving some officials worried about the agency’s ability to battle forest blazes. More than 130 temporary firefighters, who typically are hired to beef up crews from May to November, were laid off this week in the Angeles National Forest, as the start of the fiscal year forced forest officials to plan for an expected $2 million budget cut, officials said. In the San Bernardino National Forest, about 120 temporary firefighters were laid off, and similar layoffs were reported in the Los Padres and Cleveland National Forests. The layoffs will mean that engine companies will respond to fires with three-person rather than five-person crews and fire stations will no longer operate seven days a week but will cover the forests on an overlapping five-day-a-week schedule. In ad-' dition, U.S. Forest Service firefighters will rely more heavily on help from municipal and county fire departments. Forest officials said the layoffs are risky. The key in wild-land forest management, as we say, is Tlit 'em hard and keep 'em small,’” said Angeles Forest fire management officer Tom Harbour. *If you hit a fire hard at the beginning, it won’t become a danger to anyone but the firefighters. It’s when a fire escapes that it causes problems.... And as far as what’s going to happen vdth fires escaping, well, that’s going to be a crapshoot now.” Forest Service officials in Washington blamed a lack of planning at the national forest level for the sudden personnel",
