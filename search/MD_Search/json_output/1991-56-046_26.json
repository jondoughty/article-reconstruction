    "article_text": "This time of year, the bright clusters of monarch butterflies adorning eucalyptus boughs south of Pismo Beach look more like like huge clumps of orange leaves than collections of insects. Wliile the butterflies hang in filtered sunlight, members of Cal Poly’s biological sciences department conduct studies that may help scientists understand more about the migration and habits of the delicate travelers, some of whom have flown in from as far away as Canada. “This is our own research project,” said Kingston Leong, an instructor in the biological sciences department. “Initially we started with the state parks; now we’re doing it on our own just to unravel things. It’s like a puzzle — the more we unravel, the moi'e we find out.” Leong said that each fall monarchs fi’om east of the Rocky Mountains head south toward central Mexico. “That is the main population, close to five or six million.”",
