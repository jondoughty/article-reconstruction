That’s why art and design major Malt Faye decided he was going to win First place in this year’s contest. “After last year, I was bent on winning,” Faye said, “and I set out to do just that.” The 2S-year-old junior said he couldn’t even begin to describe the amount of lime it took him to construct the winning poster. “It was a lot of work,” Faye said, “but it’s going to be worth it. “I almost dropped my other classes in a trash can just to get it done!” First prize included $I(X) cash and lunch at F. McLintock’s in Shell Beach. “The prize is nothing compared to the poster I’ll have in my hands,” Faye said. He described the prize as “Fame, fortune and recognition — and my own poster! They could have had a swift kick in the pants for a prize and I would have worked just as hard.” The last few posters have been loo graphic-oriented, Faye said. “I wanted to be more illustrative,” he said. “I wanted to show diversity and the different majors on campus.” Faye’s poster portrays the theme of the 57ih annual Poly Royal. “Unity Through Diversity.” It is constructed in 3-D, made from cut cansón paper. The reproductions, however, will have shadows to show depth instead of the original 3-D, Faye said. “I had to do a poster I could afford,” Faye said. ”1 always wanted to do a paper sculpture, and it was cheap. “I’m really enthusiastic about having won. For an art and design major, getting a poster printed isa big deal.” “There was mass chaos. There were kids running in every direction.” “I was there right away,” said Cheryl Torres, whose 11-year-old daughter, LeAnne Sundstrom, is a student at the school. “ ... there were a dozen students lying on the ground. It was very frighten-ing. Deputy Police Chief Ralph Tribble said the gunman, dressed in battle gear and wearing a flak jacket, apparently set his car on fire as a diversion before entering the Cleveland Elementary School campus with two handguns and an AK-47 assault rifle and opening fire. He killed three children in the schoolyard and the other two inside the school. At least one teacher was injured; the rest of the wounded were students, said Tribble. Neely identified the dead students as Raphanar Or, 9, a boy; and girls Ram Chun, 8; Thuy Tran, 6, Sokhim An, 6, and Oeun Lim, 8. All were children of refugee families from Southeast Asia. Lt. Fred Nixon of the Los Angeles Police Department described the AK-47 as a “military assault rifle. You use it for one purpose and one purpose only — to kill a human being.” The AK-47 is a Russian design, but Chinese replicas are available in many gun stores for around $300. It is capable of firing about 600 rounds per minute on full automatic, although automatic weapons are illegal in California. The 1977 Chevrolet station wagon bore Oregon license plates.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Investigators hope photographs taken by low-flying military airplanes will turn up clues in the cases of two missing girls, including 9-year-old Michaela Garecht of Hayward, FBI officials said Tuesday. The sophisticated aerial search, to be conducted Wednesday if weather permits, is one of two advanced and relatively new techniques the FBI will utilize in the searches, according to Richard Held, special agent in charge of te San Francisco office. Held also released a computer-enhanced photograph of what experts say kidnap victim Kevin Collins may look like today. Collins disappeared from San Francisco on Feb. 10, 1984 at the age of ten. On the eve of Kevin’s 15th birthday Jan. 24, Held said the new image helps investigators “have some idea of the Kevin Collins that we’re looking for today as opposed to the Kevin Collins we were looking for in 1983.’’ To make the photograph, which is based on the best available picture of the boy, exF>erts looked at how the aging process has changed the appearance of Kevin’s two older brothers, particularly 16-year-old Gary, Held said. The photo is part of a flyer which will be released to FBI offices and law enforcement agencies nationwide and will hopefully help generate renewed public interest. Held said. “We need public assistance to locate these children,’’ he said. Seven-year-old Amber Swartz-Garcia of Pinole vanished June 3 just minutes after she went outside to jump rope. Michaela was kidnapped Nov. 19 outside a neighborhood grocery store near her home in Hayward. Witnesses, including an 8-year-old playmate of Michaela’s, said the abductor was a white man in his early 20s, about 6 feet tall with shoulder-length, blond hair and a pockmarked or pimpled face. The fourth-grader’s disappearance has generated unprecedented community response and a massive volunteer effort. The reward for her safe recently reached $178,000. magistrate, denying bail to the alleged kingpin of Oakland narcotics, told a hearing Tuesday he would be “an imbecile’’ to disregard the record of 20-year-old Darryl Reed and the circumstances of his arrest. “I can’t take the risk ... it’s too big a risk,’’ to fix bail, said U.S. Magistrate Wayne Brazil at a detention hearing for Reed, arrested\tDec. 8 allegedly while in the act of “cooking up’’ 30.4 pounds of rock cocaine in an apartment. Officers reported seizing items including coke, crack, various packagings, $60,000 in cash and a .4S-caIiber automatic. Reed was charged with possession of cocaine for sale, possession and con-piracy to make and sell crack, and the weapons count. The drugs alone, including around IS pounds of cocaine hydrochloride, were worth $3 million. police have said. Reed allegedly had cocaine dust on his hands and was carrying a big metal soup pot from the stove to the kitchen sink when police broke down the apartment door. On conviction he could draw a minimum of 15 years in prison and a maximum of life imprisonment. He has pleaded innocent. At the time of the arrest, Reed had five months left of probation on a prior weapons conviction. Brazil ordered Reed to appear in U.S. District Court Feb. 8. The seizure was the biggest such crack haul “in the history of the United States,’’ Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Dondero told the court in arguing against bail for Reed. Narcotics officers have described Reed as the drug dealer who “supplies all the other cocaine dealers” in Oakland, and markets “a minimum of 50 pounds a week.” Second and third place were won by Eric Roinestad and Kathryn Otoshi, also art and design majors. Roinestad received a $50 gift certificate from Law’s Hobby Center and Otoshi received a $30 gift certificate from Graham’s Art Supply. The winners were chosen from more than 40 entries and are displayed in the University Union Galerie. Faye’s poster will be released March 1. these conditions because members of my race are free in a way that black people were not free in 1963, and that Martin Luther King, Jr. was not free as long as he lived.” On a balcony in Memphis, Tenn., April 4, 1968, a shot fired from a hidden sniper stole the life of 39-year-old King, the clergyman and civil rights leader who was instrumental in making America look at the way it treated blacks. There was no time for goodbyes to the millions of blacks and whites across America who had focused their hopes on King as the spokesman for human dignity. The dreamer was murdered but the dream could not be — the dream lives on in people like Covin who was invited to Cal Poly as part of the Distinguished Afro-American Lecture Series. ‘‘We are likely to forget that Martin Luther King’s active political life spanned about 13 years,” Covin said. ‘‘He was a youth in comparison to me.” Covin said the center of King’s life was Christianity, not the often artificial kind shown on TV, but the kind that demands ac- Covin condemned Jerry Falwell, Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker as examples of the kinds of men who perpetrate meanness, bigotry or pettiness. King believed Christianity meant loving your neighbor. ‘‘He used his religion,” Covin said. ‘‘But instead of the way others have used it for meanness and pettiness he used it for a broader vision of humanity and justice.” Covin said he wanted to help establish the manner in which King’s birthday is celebrated. ‘‘I think the first several years of observation will set the precedent for how this holiday is to be observed,” Covin said. ‘‘This could be a time of superficialities and banalities. ‘‘This could become a time of pointless memorial marches. It could become a time of sales in retail stores. It could become a time of hearing the same speeches and seeing the same videotapes and films over and over again. I hope it becomes Covin said the celebration should be a reflective time, for examining the treatment of blacks in this country. ‘‘In 1963 black people talked about ‘freedom now!’ — they talked about it because they did not feel free,” Covin said. ‘‘They were imprisoned by a system of laws and institutions which specifically and explicitly imposed a position of inferiority on them.” Covin said that in the South his life could be taken from him for no reason. He related an experience he had in 1964 when he was working with a racially integrated group in the South. They had stopped for lunch at a restaurant for blacks, the only place a racially mixed group could eat together. ‘‘By the time I got ready to sit down all the tables were full,” Covin said. ‘‘I was the only one in my group without a seat so I went to the counter. The man I sat’ next to looked at me then he looked back at the group I was in. Then he looked back at me awhile and said ‘do you know where you is?’ I nodded and said ‘Ido.’ ‘‘He looked at me awhile longer then he said, ‘Yeah, well, you in Mississippi — you and me they doesn’t think much of us here, they just as soon kill you as look at you.’ He asked me if I understood. He was trying to save my life.” Covin said another time, while he was working for the civil rights movement in Alabama in the 60s, that a white minister had to sneak on and off the campus of a black college. ‘‘He came to speak to us ... if any white people had known, that would have been the end of his ministry and it might have been the end of his life,” Covin said. ‘‘That was not freedom for anyone — black or white.” Covin said that many critics of the civil rights movement have said it lacked a focus. “It is not true that the goals of the civil rights movement were vague,” he said. “The goals were so obvious and so clear they didn’t have to be defined. When people said they wanted freedom, any fool could see what they meant.” Blacks wanted a say in the government, freedom from routine assaults, freedom from harassment and freedom to eat inside of restaurants instead of having to use the take-out window because it was illegal to go inside. Covin said. In short, freedom meant to be treated like human beings. “They wanted futures for their children which were not demeaning and degrading,” Covin said. “Freedom. Freedom from those horrible, monstrous, terrifying and oppressive conditions. Freedom — the end of that madness.” Academic Senate Research Committee will then review each project and the 10 best will be sent to Long Beach for a statewide competition to be held May S and 6.” Each entry will be judged on the quality of the research, the quality of the presentation, and on the presentor’s ability to stimulate and respond to inquiries. “First place winners in each category will be awarded $500 and each runner-up will receive $200.

Regan’s “kiss and tell’’ book, has disclosed that he quietly prepared for his former aide’s departure for months before he left. The president, in an interview broadcast on Cable News Network on Monday, insisted, “There was no firing at all.” However, the president added that he planned to use a letter of resignation ™Regan had submitted months before. “1 set out at the same time, then, to start quietly, and hoping, leakproof, to have a successor on hand for when he announced the time he was going to go,” Reagan said. Reagan acknowledged in the interview that Regan had been having problems with Nancy Reagan, the first lady, and that one of his weaknesses as president is that “I know that I have a soft heart.” Regan, who had been Treasury secretary, and then-White House chief of staff James A. Baker III told the president they wanted to switch jobs in early 1985, and he approved the request. Regan left at the end of February 1987, at the height of the Iran-Contra scandal, and was replaced by former Sen. Howard Baker, R-Tenn. Reagan insisted at the time he did not fire Regan, saying Regan had indicated at some earlier time he wanted to return to private business. In\tthe\tMonday night interview, however, Reagan said he quietly hoped to be able use a letter of resignation which Regan had submitted months earlier when the chief of staff indicated he would not likely serve through Reagan’s entire second term. “There was one of those leaks that seems to be so prevalent in this institution,” the president said. “And it leaked publicly. And I guess he felt insulted.” Regan was infuriated when there were news reports of his resignation in late February 1986, coupled with reports of Baker’s selection. CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw, at one point, asked Reagan about Maureen Reagan’s interview statement that allowing Regan to become chief of staff had been her father’s biggest mistake. “I saw that. Happened to be watching television and saw that,” he replied. Asked if he disagreed with her statement, the president said, “No, I said, ‘That’s my girl.’ ” flare. Despite the ill-will. Poly stayed close until Bill Archer hit a three pointer to tie the game at 64-64. The teams traded possessions for the next few minutes until Poly grabbed the lead 66-64 with 3:18 left to go. Poly extended the lead to six, but the Roadrunners refused to die. After a breakaway basket, the lead was cut to two, James Gamma iced the win by hitting both ends of the one-and-one making the final score 78-73. One bright spot for the Mustangs was the first-half play of Errol Talley, who came in for starting Kurt Colvin who had picked up two quick fouls. Talley’s first contribution was a blocked shot on one end and a three-point play at the other. Talley converted three straight three-point opportunities and finished the half with 11 points. The Mustangs shot 50 percent in the first half compared to 27 percent the shot in its previous game against Millersville. Junior James Gamma led all scores with 18 points, followed by n.C Cashman, with 14.",
