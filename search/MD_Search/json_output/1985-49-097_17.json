    "article_text": "INGLEWOOP. CaUf. (AP) -The Edmonton Oilers, safely past the opening round, aren’t letting themselves relax in their quest to repeat as Stanley Cup champions. ' < “We haven’t won anything yet. We need 12 more wins to get it,” said Oilers winger-Glenn Anderson, whose overtime goal Saturday night lifted Edmoi^on to a 4-3 victory and a tnree-game sweep of the Los Angeles Kings. The narrow victory was not unlike, the Oilers’ first two victories in the series in Edmonton. They edged the Kings 3-2 in overtime in the first game and 4-2 on an empty-net goal in the second. “This jvas a close series, and _ all three games could have gone either way,” said Edmonton Coach Glen Sather. Sather said the Oilers could not have won without the deft goaltending they got from Grant Fuhr. ' The difference was the play of Fuhr and our playoff experience,” said Sather. Wayhe Gretzky, who did not score a goal in the series, said. “Goaltending is the playoffs. It's been that way for 50 years. \"\t* The Oilers are expecting the rest of the playoffs to be just like this hard-fought series. “It seems that everytime you get past a smaller mountain, there's a bigger mountain waiting around the corner,” said Anderson. If nothing else, the Kings, who played well against the Oilers in the regular season, once again proved themselves a stern test for the defending champs. “We have to optimistic about next year,“ said Los Angeles wing Dave Taylor. “We made some great strides.” SURFB0ARD8ft, sing, fin, w/leash, great shape, min. dings 870 Mike 5430983 Technical drawing pens.
