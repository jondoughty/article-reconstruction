    "article_text": "President Warren Baker delivered promising news to the engineering technology faculty members after touring their department Friday. In a private meeting with the faculty, Baker told them that every student in the department will graduate with an ET degree, according to Department Head Kim Davis. They were also told that no tenured or tenure-track faculty will be laid off for fall quarter. Baker did not say what will happen after then. “The question still remains who would teach the ET courses if the faculty aren’t around after fall,” Davis said. However, he was pleased with the news. “We’ve gained a major breakthrough from Baker.” The ET students agreed, although they still plan to continue protesting the proposed phaseout. “We’re on (to continue protesting) for Monday,” said John Luna, president of the American Society of Engineering Technologists. “The decision is not over yet.” During the meeting, Davis presented Baker with some alternatives to cutting the ET curriculum. He suggested moving ET programs, including all students and faculty, into complementary engineering departments. Davis said that Baker “just glanced at the proposal,” but he said he would look it over in depth later. “There is no question of the value of our department,” Davis said. “Baker does see technology and engineering working together.” The faculty members said that Baker seemed impressed with the students during the tour. “He stressed it over and over,” professor Fred Friedman said. “They really did a fantastic job.” During the hourlong tour, students showed lab work, typical homework assignments and senior projects. Baker listened intently and asked questions throughout the tour. The presentations emphasized the correlation between the course work and the work graduates do in the industry. 17 tourists die when bus drives into ravine VITORIA, Spain (AP) — A bus carrying tourists from Lisbon to Paris careened off a road in northern Spain on Saturday, killing 17 people and injuring 31 others, authorities said. A survivor said the driver had fallen asleep. The bus, carrying 46 passengers, plowed through a safety barrier and into a ravine outside the northern Spanish town of Vitoria, police said. The dead, including a 5-year-old girl, were Portuguese, one of them a Portuguese-born French citizen. Of the injured, 17 remained hospitalized late Saturday. Police said one New Zealander, two French nationals and two Dutch citizens were among those hospitalized. Portugal’s news agency Lusa quoted passenger Maria de Nazare Carvalho, 57, as saying the driver apparently fell asleep at the wheel. She said she had suggested he allow the co-driver to take over. The fall of the bus was broken by a load lost by a truck that had overturned at the same spot earlier in the week, news reports said. WASHINGTON (AP) — In the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots, the blows that struck Rodney King are reverberating in courtrooms throughout the nation. A judge in Washington state has postponed the trial of a former police officer out of fear that jurors, mindful of the King case, might treat him unfairly. Law enforcement officials, lawyers and judges elsewhere have expressed similar fears, and hopes, that the riots will make jurors in police brutality cases think twice before they render verdicts. “I don’t think there’s any question that ... it’s going to carry over into the courtroom,” said Bobby Stout, executive director of the Wichita, Kan., Crime Commission. “I don’t know how you can avoid it — or if you want to avoid it.” There are two threads that run through discussions about the impact of the King verdict. One is that it will make jurors fearful about the ramifications of acquitting a police officer accused of brutality. The other is that it will make courts more sensitive to bias against minorities. Think about a social situation that doesn’t involve communication. Think about it... everything we do in life involves communication. As students, we spend a great deal of our time devoted to listening. We listen to professors, public, peers, television and radio. Statistics reveal the majority of our time is spent listening, but the question to ask yourself is how are you listening? Actively? Passively? Effectively? I find it surprising that we are constantly reinforced to improve our writing and reading skills, but not our listening. Ek> we feel our listening potential has been reached? The fact is most of us are relatively poor listeners. Given the amount of time we engage in listening, the improvement of this skill would seem well worth the required effort. Listening is not an easy task. It takes time and energy to listen effectively. However, through the power of listening, friendships and other relationships can blossom and grow positively. California State University crime statistics show Cal Poly as one of the safest campuses in the CSU system. Unfortunately, this may cause some students to think less about their safety than they should. “People need to think about it all the time,” said Joseph Risser, Director of ^bic Safety. “They need to think about safety first rather than the convenience of ‘Well, ni just cut through here,’ ” he said. Cal Poly had one violent crime reported in 1991. The highest number reported was 50, at CSU Northridge. As far as property is concerned, Cal Poly’s parking lots seem to be getting safer. Thefts from motor vehicles are down from 217 in 1990 to 125 in 1991. Only seven cars were reported stolen last year. Bikes thefts have decreased as well, with 61 reported stolen in 1991, compared to 93 in 1990. Risser said that thefts of bikes and cars go in cycles, and that the police pay special attention to parking lots when problems start appearing. Many of the car thefts are committed by outside groups, he said. All of these statistics are compiled from reported offenses. Risser said the department tries hard to encourage people to report any t)q)e of crime, but that the negative image of police held by some segments of the public can make that hard. Thefts from campus buildings were up from 91 in 1990 to 123 in 1991. Risser said that this may be because the campus key-security system is not a good one. He said there are a lot of people with keys who can leave doors open, or feel safe and don’t bother to lock them. Of crimes against people. Cal Poly was second-highest in reported sex offenses in 1991 with 18, one up from the previous year, and nine more than 1989. San Diego State reported 25. Risser said that he didn’t know if people were reporting them more, or if they were increasing in frequency. Cal Poly rates well, compared to national statistics from a USA Tbday survey, which show that in the West, there are 7.2 violent crimes per every 10,000 students. The survey also said that the safest campuses are those with between 10,000 and 20,000 students in a city under 100,000. Risser said that most students don’t have safety as a priority, because of the location of the school and the small number of incidents. “People get the impression that it’s safe here, so (they) don’t have to think about where (they’re) walking,” he said. “That’s not d good idea.” One example is the microwave technology loeing taught. It exposes students to the practical hardware seen in the industry, professor Neill Clark said. Clark worked at Hewlett Packard for several years before coming to Cal Poly. His connections enable the department to acquire valuable equipment for the students’ practical education, said Kevin Wright, an ET senior. One of the senior projects Baker saw was done by the Society of Automotive Engineers. Of the group’s seven members, three are ET majors. The group designed and built a vehicle that may revolutionize the stability of a car, Vince Ter-zian, an ET senior told Baker. It is being tested on the General Motors test track, Terzian said. “Without the ET majors, this vehicle would not have been able to be produced,” Terzian said. limits. She said there is a need for people who will stand for something even when it is unpopular. “True leadership is when one is ahead of the problem and one can go out and inspire people and convince them of what needs to be done,” she said. Huffington said her husband, Michael, recognizes the need for fundamental values that include building up the family unit and encouraging responsibility toward others. All levels of government, especially nationally, need to set priorities on education, she said. Recognizing the problems with education is to recognize the problems with the economy. Michael Huffington plans to reduce the deficit by revamping the country’s welfare system and making it into a transitional program, she said. That way people will not be able to make living off welfare a way of fife. She said people need to feel that they can take care of themselves. Whemver the perennial debate over capital punishment heats up, as it has again in California with the execution of Robert Alton Harris, I reach for my copy of Albert Camus’ classic 1957 essay “Reflections on the Guillotine,” published in the Nobel Prize-winning French author’s b<x)k “Resistance, Rebellion and Death.” Many firm believers in capital punishment have been converted into abolitionists after reading this essay. One argument by Camus should be particularly compelling for conservatives who support the death penalty yet oppose excessive government power. Camus reversed the conventional rationale for capital punishment as a defense of the social order against individual criminals. On the contrary, he asserted, in the Twentieth Century, “State crimes have been far more numerous than individual crimes...Hence our society must protect herself not so much against the individual as against the State.” According to Camus, the secular State has made itself into an absolute power, usurping God’s authority as Last Judge in believing it has the omniscience to determine who shall live and who shall die. Camus recognized that criminals too play God, but he believed capital punishment is an even more arrogant act because in it the State defies its own fallible legal processes. Shouldn’t those conservatives who are so quick to point out every flaw in governmental and judicial bureaucracies acknowledge the human flaws in that ultimate bureaucratic power, the death sentence? Judicial norms are not only error-prone but relative to different times and places. In 1960, Caryl Chessman was executed in California for kidnapping and rape, the Rosonbergs in 1953 for spying — neither of those sentences would be imposed today. Bribery is a capital offense in Communist countries — a policy that would decimate the population of America’s p>oliticjEil and business elite. A hundred years ago we hung cattle rustlers, so why not car thieves now? Those who cite the Bible as authority for the death penalty must believe, as indicated therein, that execution is warranted for witchcraft;, cursing one’s parent, adultery and premarital sex, or fatal attack by one’s ox. Thus this year’s norms for execution may change next year — too late for those already killed. And if we agree on grounds for the death penalty, should we implement it * with “humane” lethal injections like Texas or more “vengeful” means? If we believe ih the most harsh revenge, why not revert to boiling in oil or crucifixion — or more logically yet, keep the wotst criminals alive and torture them daily? Camus believed the death penalty is a blasphemy against Jesus Christ, who counseled those without guilt to cast the first stone and who himself was the victim of execution in “a staggering judicial error.” (Comedian Lenny Bruce mused that if Christ had lived in our time, Christians would henceforth wear miniature electric chairs on their necklaces.) What kind of model of Christian mercy were the demonstrators who stood outside San Quentin as Harris died, singing, “Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is?” Camus also argued that the State sets a negative example for its individual members in the acceptance of violence: “Bloodthirsty laws make bloodthirsty customs.” Camus presented evidence that increasing execu- tions and dealing more brutally with criminals in general serves less to deter the criminal mentality than tö incite its morbid and hostile impulses. The only way to break this vicious circle, Camus advised, is for government (over which we have the control we don’t have over individual criminals) to take the first steps toward de-escalating violence — advice taken by Frances Mitterand in abolishing the death penalty when he took office as president of PrEuice in 1981, with no subsequent increase in that country’s crime rate. In Camus’ analysis, we are all to some degree the product of our society; thus society bears some share of responsibility for breeding criminals. Most executed criminals — including Harris — have grown up in poverty and many have been abused as children. Alcohol and drugs frequently contribute to their crimes, yet those who profit from slum housing or selling criminals alcohol and drugs, as well as deadly weapons, are absoTved of any responsibility. Camus was not, however, a bleeding heart absolving the individual: “The instinct of preservation in societies, and hence of individuals, requires that individual responsibility be p>ostu-lated and accepted without dreaming of an absolute indulgence that would amount to the death of all society. But the same reasoning must lead us to conclude that there never exists any total responsibility.” His point was that even if society bears only one percent of the blame, by executing criminals rather than viewing the cost of life imprisonment as payment for its own share of blame, it absolves itself 100 percent. “Society proceeds sovereignty to eliminate the evil ones from her midst as if she were virtue itself. Like an honorable man killing his wayward son and remarking: ‘Really, I didn’t know what to do with him.’” For society’s self-protection, Camus advocated replacing capital punishment with life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for the most vicious criminals, and preventing their escape by isolating them on a Devil’s Island or Alcatraz. (He would also allow them the option of suicide, which makes more sense than when Utah authorities pumped Gary Gilmore’s stomach out of a self-induced overdose of pills in order to keep him alive for the firing squad.) Camus and abolitionists are not, as often charged, indifferent to victims and their survivors. Nothing can bring the victims back to life, but abolitionists suggest that the high costs of the legal process preceding execution, as well as the proceeds from imprisoned criminals’ labor. could be redirected toward compensating survivors. There are alternatives between execution and lax policies that permit release of dangerous criminals; certainly, opponents of the death penalty need to join with advocates in insisting in closing the outrageous loopholes that allow unregenerate killers to go free. As Camus concluded, “We know enough to say that this or that major criminal deserved hard labor for life. But we don’t know enough to decree' that he be shorn of his future...Forbidding a man’s execution would amount to proclaiming publicly that society and the State are not absolute values, that nothing authorizes them to legislate definitively or to bring about the irreparable.” Don Lazere is a professor of English at Cal Poly and author of The Unique Creation of Albert Camus, published by Yale University Press. The Cal Poly College Republicans heard about “Civil Rights Awareness Week” two weeks ago. We have been working with U.S. Civil Rights Commissioner Bill Allen on his bid for U.S. Senate. We (the College Republicans) decided that this would be a great opportunity to offer our contribution to, what we believed to be, a national civil rights week. We had no idea that “Civil Rights Awareness Week” was an exclusive event to Cal Poly. We talked to Bill Allen and he agreed to come talk in San Luis Obispo. With their backs to the fences, the No. 3-ranked Cal Poly Mustangs swept two games from Cal State San Bernardino to take a share of the California Collegiate Athletic Association championship. The two victories enabled Cal Poly to win the CCAA for the second consecutive year and the third out of the last four years. Cal Poly will start preparing for next weekend’s Western ^gionals of the Division II NCAA College World Series. It will be announced sometime today where the regionals are going to be played and who will be participating. “The fun begins now,” said Cal Poly Head Coach Steve McFarland. “I told the guys that they should not agonize anymore. They accomplished something great. “It’s an honor to play in the regionals. They have worked really hard this year and they deserve to be where they are right now.” Cal Poly finishes the regular season with an overall record of 35-16 and 20-10 in the CCAA. The Coyotes finish the regular season at the bottom of the CCAA with a 7-23 record. , In the first game. Cal Poly gave starting pitcher Paul Souza plenty of breathing room with some explosive offense to win, 6-3. I Irt what is becoming a common occurrence in the CCAA, Cal Poly pitcher Eric Hill hdd yet another dominating performance in the second game to help Cal Poly win, 5-2. “We played a lot better tonight,” McFarland said, referring to Friday’s 6-4 loss. “We eliminated some frustrations and played solid baseball.” In the first game. Cal Poly got an early See BASEBALL, page 6 It might be considered sexist. Possibly blatantly so. Yet, to have the overwhelmingly urge to kneel down and kiss John Zimmerman’s ring finger must not be that unusual. Zimmerman holds the dubious record for photographing the most Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues. Seven times the photographer has visually knocked SI readers out with his array of shots depicting the smallest swimsuits on the world’s top female models. Zimmerman was on campus Saturday along with a handful of othe'* who’s who in photographers to watch — or take part in — a presentation opening Mark Kauffman’s art show titled “A Slice of Life.” Kauffman, Zimmerman and John Dominis, another photographer on hand Saturday, all have astonished people with their photojournalism for decades. Saturday was no exception. Speaking sports of course, the threesome have provided SI and Life readers rolls upon rolls of historic film of athletes and events. Kauffman will forever be remembered for shooting the first Sports Illustrated cover shot of the Milwaukee Braves’ Eddie Mathews at County Stadium in Milwaukee. Dominis, Si’s photo editor from 1979-82 and fellow Life photographer, showed his ensemble Saturday at the presentation. Among those was a black-and-white shot of Mickey Mantle at Yankee Stadium. Dominis told a standing-room-only crowd at Fisher Science room 286 that he was assigned to take photographs of the popular \"Yankee slugger during his later — and least productive — years. Dominis’ shot shows Mantle, against a backdrop of a sold out Yankee Stadium, throwing his batting helmet in disgust after an at-bat. “The one thing we did a lot (at Life) was to try to think up what would be a real interesting picture,” Dominis said afterwards. “Y)u want to give yourself a tough problem, instead of giving yourself an easy problem. Ybu can solve almost any problem if you struggle with it.” Dominis said that the creativity Life photographers yearned for, and provided readers time after time on a weekly basis before television appeared, was lost at Sports Illustrated.

San Bernardino scored two runs off Souza and one run off relief pitcher Chal Fanning, who relieved Souza in the ninth inning with no outs. Souza, who came into the game with a 6-2 record in the CCAA and a 2.98 ERA, gave up only three hits and struck out four players in eight innings of work. “I think the key to the game was that we were able to get an early lead,” McFarland said. “We really jumped on the ball.” In game two. Hill was, once again, the key to the game. Hill, who came in with a 6-1 record and 2.37 ERA in the CCAA, pitched all seven innings, struck out six and gave up five hits. which propelled them into the championship match against No. 3-seeded Hampton from Virginia. “Davis played a good match,” Poly Head Coach Chris Eppright said in a tone that clearly stated his disappointment. “Both teams were fired up and ready to play. (Davis) really took it to us. That’s by far the best match (Davis) played all year. “It’s tough*. Everyone is obviously disappointed because we were hoping to win. We got up in a few instances, but we let them back into it.” The match at the third seed was the example Eppright offered to prove his last statement. Marc Ollivier won the first set, 6-1, but then Davis’ Mark Lamonica came on strong and won in three sets. “The other matches weren’t close at all,” Eppright said. “We got killed.” The two Mustang victories came from No. 2-seeded Mark Nielson and No. 5-seeded Jeff Ar-nott. Nielson defeated Dave Allen, 6-3, 6-1. “The only surprise was at No. 2 where we had lost both times before, but we won this time easily,” Eppright said. Amott beat Jeff McCann, 6-1, 6-2. The Mustangs’ No. 3-seeded doubles. Josh Johnston and Jeff Amott, lost to Mark Ebner and Lamonica, 6-3, 6-3. The loss sealed the victory for the Aggies. UC Davis advanced by defeating No. 8-seeded Southwest Baptist from Missouri in the first round. On Sunday, the Mustangs rebounded by demolishing Rollins, 5-1. “It’s tough playing for third or fourth,” Eppright said. “They had such a go(^ year.” The Mustangs captured five of the six singles matches against Rollins, who beat Poly last year in the national championships. Poly’s No. 1-seed Max Allman led the charge with a convincing 6-4, 6-2 win over Darren Price, Rollin’s top-seeded player. Ollivier, Ricardo Reyes, Steve Amott and Josh Johnston also recorded victories for Poly. The Mustangs advanced to play against UC Davis by defeating No. 6-seeded Airostrong State from Savannah, Ga. The only losses suffered against Armstrong State were at the top two seeds. there, the one thing I didn’t ei\\joy too much about it was that they always had to have the news,” he said. “They had to have the main event. Which meant that you had to have a lot of photographers because you didn’t want to miss that one touchdown. So, it kind of stifles creativity. “For Life ... we would definitely try to not do the same thing. We would tiy to look for something else, some other angle.” SI also presents another problem to editors and photographers alike — the jinx. Both Domini s and Zimmerman discussed the mysterious, yet ongoing curse that fixates itself on an athlete that appears on Si’s front cover. “Oh, you heard about it all the time,” Dominis said. “Maybe it went to the guy’s head a little bit being on the cover of Sports Illustrated. And maybe it fouled him up a little bit... I suppose it’s possible. But, we never believed in it.” For some unknown reason, the spell has yet to affect models, Zimmerman said. “No never heard it on a girl, but on baseball players and football players. I mean (athletes) would not run away. But they were worried about it,” he said. “Athletes, but never beautiful girls. Because once the beautiful girl is on the cover, that means she immediately that year will get a contract with ... Revlon or big beauty companies that’s worth at least a.quarter of million dollars.” Zimmerman has photographed numerous other athletes and events athletes, including five Olympic games. Kauffman, who tossed out hilarious one-liners between presentations, seemed to wrap up Saturday’s event nicely afterwards. “Lot of history seen through those eyes.” education because of the cutbacks/ • she said. In her speech, Clinton explained how education has suffered because of the lack of funding for resources in addition to the increased amount of money allocated for non-educational services. “What Bill proposes doing is increasing that federal share (for education), back to what it was in 1980,” she said. Little did Clinton know these words of educational reform were broadcast over an audio system setup by a Cal Poly engineering technology student. Senior Jason Bradley, an employee of Cal Central Lighting and Sound, had arrived early Friday morning to prepare for the breakfast. “I brought in a bunch of equipment and then set it up,” Bradley said. “It’s great irony.” Inside the restaurant, honking car horns could be heard sporadically throughout the breakfast. John Luna, president of the American Society of Engineering Technologists and an ET senior, was pleased with the student support he has seen. “Every honk they (the administrators attending the breakfast) heard is an audible voice from us that says, Tley keep us in mind ... We are going to be a thorn in your side.’” Luna said. Close to 40 demonstrators lined the sidewalk to see Clinton on her way out. As she left, Clinton stopped briefly to speak with the demonstrators again and was given two T-shirts. Initially, Luna approached Clinton and presented her with an ET T-shirt. Then home economics major Kimberly McIn- tyre spoke briefly with Clinton and handed her a home ec T-shirt. Clinton responded to the students with gratitude and stressed the need for active voting to make a change. “It is just so important, not just for individual students but for a country, that we put education first and I hope that we can do that, but we cannot do it if people do not vote,” she said. During the breakfast, three ET majors sat inside, waiting for a chance to question Clinton on her husband’s educational goals. “Being that their campaign platform includes education ... we came today to voice our concerns about the changing education in the state of California,” said Gregory Thompson, an ET senior sitting inside the restaurant. But unfortunately, there wasn’t enough time. Moria Riorday, a graduating senior in ET, was able to speak with Clinton and presented her with an ET packet. It contained a personal letter, an ET fact sheet, a memo from the ET department head to Vice President for Academic Affairs Robert Koob outlining other options, a memo from the Engineering Council and clips from Mustang Daily. ASI President-elect Kristin Burnett was in attendance and complimented the ET and home ec students on an organized and effective showing. “I think that it (the demonstration) is both respectful and wise of them, because they are keeping it at the forefront of everybody’s attention,” she said. Neill Clark, a member of the ET faculty, was on hand to watch his students in action. Another essential issue Clinton said her husband shows eagerness to take on is health care, an issue he would pay immediate attention to should he be elected. His plans for improving health care include steps such as controlling costs, reforming insurance practices and providing better access for primary and preventive health care. “We are so penny-wise and dollar-foolish when it comes to our health care system in this country,” Clinton said. Clinton said prenatal care, which costs up to $1,000, should be given to every American woman. This would save from having to pay as much as $150,000 to keep babies alive that were bom to women who went without prenatal care. In concluding the overview of her husband’s platform, she noted two issues that apply specifically to California. She told the audience that her husband wants everyone to view economic development and environmental protection as mutual support goals, not competing goals. Energy conservation was the other issue which she said she feels is important to this state. Natural gas should be used more, and more research should be conducted to find new methods of using fuel. She then told the audience she hopes that those who support this campaign support Clinton for the reasons he is in this race. “I think what America needs now is a leader who will say to all of us, Tes, we’ve got some rough times in front of us,’ ” Clinton said. “An-yone who watched the television last week knows v/e have deep and profound problems, but -you know, we have a real opportunity as well. That opportunity is to demonstrate that we’re not only problem-solvers, but we are builders. We are people who want to build a new vision. “Ultimately, what we have to do is reach across the cynicism, the negativism and the despair that people in all walks of life are feeling in America today. “We have to get people to believe again that we can make a difference. If we carry that message, there is no doubt in my mind, we will not only have a new president, we will have a new beginning that can give America some of its greatest days it has ever had,” she said before receiving a standing ovation. • Clinton said she would have told students the same thing as she told the fund-raiser audience if time would have allowed for her to address the students. “I think the message of economic hope and employment and education opportunity is a message not just for young people,” Clinton said in between shaking hands after her speech. “It is a message for all Americans.” Robert Koob, vice president of Academic Affairs, said Cal Poly was fortunate to have Clinton on campus because it will bring attention to the campus and the community, and it shows they count. Koob said he attended the fund-raiser to show general support for the election process, and to try and represent the university in national politics. Kristin Burnett, ASI president-elect, also attended the fund-raiser.",
