    "article_text": "Like it or not, the Student Senate is our Voice to the Administration. In their recent newsletter, ASI Times, they bragged about all the resolutions passed this year already. While the effectiveness of a senate can’t be measured by the number of resolutions passed, the kind of resolutions they discuss shows what they think is important. The most notable resolutions discussed in the senate so far have been one opposing Proposition 61, one asking the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce to let us retain our seat on their board, and two concerning “ASI Official Cards” which will let senators into all ASI events for free. Only one resolution, which formed a student committee to make recommendations on the use of lottery funds, even comes close to the most important job student leaders have: advocating the student point of view to the Administration. Though the senate is powerless to actually change university policy, it can make recommendations and lobby for Administration action. For example, last year the senate got business hours extended at student support services offices and looked into putting more bike lanes on campus. Issues such as teacher shortages and curriculum changes, and ideas to make graduating in four years possible have yet to be discussed. It would be nice to see this year’s senate put aside political squabbles and do the job they were elected to do: represent student needs and fight for them to be met. There he was. Ed McMahon was smiling at me from my mailbox. Nevermind how he got all 200-plus pounds of himself in that breadbox-sized container. But there he was, telling me I may already have won millions of dollars of VALUABLE PRIZES. But that wasn’t all. Also in that batch of mail I received correspondence from a lesser-known but no less prestigious organization: “Yes, you, SUSAN JANE EDMONDSON of SAN LUIS OBISPO, CALIFORNIA have won one of these VALUABLE PRIZES:\ta 1987 Cadillac El Dorado; an A-frame home on the shore of South Lake Tahoe; a trip for two to London, Paris, Venice and Rome; $250,000 cash; or a priceless mystic Oriental gemstone. Drive now. to our warehouse in Tulare to see which prize has your name on it.” I think it may be the gemstone. Some people may complain about the reams of junk mail which circulate through their mailbox, yet they are lucky. At least this mail is rather harmless, full of flattery, and has the remote possibility of awarding riches and changing lives forever. But when you’re an editor of a newspaper the mail you receive takes on a different tone. You see, strange people in strange places such as Oregon and Utah actually believe Mustang Daily to be their Mouthpiece to the World. And we’re talking serious threats involved here. Case in point: “Editor: I want my letter of Sept. 4, on the Pharoah, published in the next issue of your school newspaper. To not publish it will guarantee that you and whoever else voted against it will be forever reincarnated in a lower order of life, meaning that you’ll never again be in a human body.” Now that’s not too bad. I’ve always wanted to be a squirrel. Then there are the frequent messages from Maple Heights, Ohio, which always begin, “As Almighty GOD, I greet you.” Now this raises a few questions in my mind. One, is there a God? Two, why is He in Ohio? Three, why is He writing to Mustang Daily instead of ending world hunger? Four, did He really tell Oral Roberts that He is going to “take him” in February? And five, if Oral Roberts is taken does that mean that he will end up in Ohio also? But the true reason I tell you all of this, kindly reader, is to warn you. On Jan. 17 1 received a letter from a Mr. Johnson in San Diego, who warned, “I am sending this letter only to the large universities for them to publish. I cannot predict the day nor hour, but only the period I believe with all my heart the quake will come in. The basis of my prediction is in the stars, as interpreted with Astrology in conjunction with my work. The period is from Jan. 23 through Feb. 1, 1987. Good luck.” There you have it. My only advice to you is to take shelter in open doorways. Don’t run around screaming like Shelley Winters. As for me, I think I’ll just donate $1,000 to Oral Roberts and pray for an afterlife with lots of acorns and a warm tree in which to sleep. Susan Edmondson is editor of Mustang Daily and she lusts after mailmen in Bermuda shorts. The two-time defending national champion Lady Broncos of Cal Poly Pomona expressed interest in a third straight crown on Saturday, rolling over the Lady Mustangs 90-62 in the Main Gym. After leading by 11 points at the half, the Lady Broncos came back to outscore the Lady Mustangs by 17 points in the second half, bringing them one step closer to their third straight NCAA title. Pomona, which leads the league in scoring with an average of 71 points, played way above average, while San Luis Obispo, second in the league in points averaged, played only a little better than normal. Mustang center Sherrie At-teberry, who leads the league in scoring with an average of 20.5 points per game, led the Lady Mustangs -in scoring Saturday with 22 points. Atteberry also led her team in free throws by making eight of 14, but said that a lot of missed shots cost them the game. “We missed a bunch of free throws and that pulled us out of the game and it was too hard to fight back,” she said. Starting guard Julie Jordan was second in scoring with 17 points, although she was playing with a bad case of the flu. Jordan commented, “We made a lot of mental errors that I think lost us the game. “I think if we had kept up with them and hadn’t made these mistakes, we would have been OK.” Mustang coach Jill Orrock called the loss a bit disappointing, but was still confident of a win against Pomona later on in the season. “The key,” said Orrock, “is that our five starters have to stay in the game and shoot well.” Orrock said that when playing the Lady Broncos her team has to take advantage of everything. “Against Pomona, you’ve got to take everything they give you,” she said. But the Lady Broncos were not giving anything the Lady Mustangs could use. The Mustangs had several players get into foul trouble trying to defense the potent Bronco attack, and by game’s end Jordan, Sherinne Barlow, Janet Jorgensen and Catherine Barlow had all fouled out. The loss of Barlow and Jorgensen was disastrous for the Mustangs, who are playing without academically ineligible freshman Trina Tualemosa. The forward was tied for first place in the league in shooting percentage, hitting at a .667 clip. The recent cold weather has meant more to the crop science department than just bringing out more warm winter clothes. According to Corwin Johnson, head of the department, the cold weather has caused some damage to the citrus and avocado groves on campus. On the night and early morning of Jan. 16 and 17, the temperature in the citrus and avocado groves and other areas of campus dropped to a record low of 23 degrees. ‘ Johnson said members of the crop science department and project classes which grow the plants began heating the area at about 11 p.m. when the temperature dropped below freezing. The area was heated with diesel burning pots, called orchard heaters, which heated the air around the trees, and a wind machine which kept frost from forming. Johnson said that although the heaters were on, workers could not hold the temperature high enough to prevent some freezing, especially on the avocado trees. The most severe damage was done to avocado trees which were out of range of the orchard heaters, but most of the trees suffered some minor damage. Johnson said that in the citrus groves, with the use of one wind machine and the orchard heaters, workers were able to hold the temperature above 28 degrees. As a result the citrus trees suffered only minor damage. Though Jan. 16 and 17 were the coldest, the workers still needed to heat the areas again the following two days. On other cold nights during the past few weeks, the temperature did not fall below 32 degrees until daybreak; as a result the air did not stay cold long enough to need heating. The cold weather also caused some minor damage to other crops on campus. Some senior project summer crops were lost, and some vegetable crops may have been set back a little in their growth. As far as long term damage from the cold snap, Johnson said there will be very little if any profit from the citrus and avocado crops because of the high cost of electricity and fuel for the heaters. In addition, some of the avocado trees may have been damaged to the point that they may not produce new buds and fruit next year. Johnson said that in the 26 years that he has been at Cal Poly, this is the most cold weather damage he has seen. According to Ronald Regan, head of the ornamental horticulture department, some potted and tropical plants outside the OH Unit suffered minor frost damage. Regan said most of the plants at the unit are grown in hothouses and therefore were protected from the cold. that counts. He called Star Wars a “magic shield” and a “cruel hoax,” and stated the biggest delusion is that strength is found in nuclear weapons. The Soviets can be contained, said Gayler, but they cannot be coerced. To contain them, he suggested realizing, “There is no sensible military use for nuclear weapons.” Gayler said he has devised a process to help bring peace. This process includes:\treducing threatening language, giving up military and nuclear war fighting doctrines, encouraging exchange, putting a moratorium on further testing and deployment and, most importantly, deep and continuous cuts in nuclear weapons. Gayler listed things the public can do to end the threat of nuclear war, rather than leaving the job up to experts. He suggested that people learn to spread the word about the danger of nuclear war. He asked that the mass media not “bury the problem under yesterday’s ball game.” He advised doctors to say to their patients, “You’re more likely to die from a nuclear war than any other single cause.” David Holloway, an authority on Soviet policy and arms control,- explained Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s new political thinking. He said detente 'needs to be understood to grasp the new thinking. Detente centers around parity, which is equality in numbers and mutual deterrence. Holloway said the process of detente totally collapsed with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Holloway went on to explain Gorbachev’s new thinking, which is based on the premise that victory is impossible with nuclear war. Holloway said that if given the choice, the Soviets would pick peace over socialism. Gorbachev has realized that security has to be mutual. Human race interests will come before proletariat issues, and the world needs cooperation as it becomes interdependent and pluralistic, he said. However, Holloway said he has seen an element of propoganda in Gorbachev’s new thinking. The Educational Peace Forum was co-sponsored by Cal Poly’s Students for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Social Responsibility.",
