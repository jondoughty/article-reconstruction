    "article_text": "Most students will never meet Cal Poly President Warren Baker because his time on campus is cut in half by his off-campus traveling. Baker spends an average of 50 percent of his time off campus, according to his secretary, Grace Arvidson. This makes it necessary to divide his time on campus very carefully between the administration, faculty, students and community. “He is very involved and would like to be more involved with a lot of other (student) groups than he can,” Arvidson said. “But he is always accessible for the things he needs to be involved with.” Frequently students will approach Arvidson with personal academic problems, asking to see Baker before using other proper channels and Arvidson will have to redirect them. “1 will refer them to someone in the academic area: their adviser, a department head, school dean, or even the vice president of Academic Affairs.” Because of his many responsibilities, Baker does not have time to meet with every student and hear their personal problems, although he will make time for students who have absolutely exhausted other channels. “1 will help students who can’t be helped by anyone else and 1 always look for informal opportunities to meet with students. That’s when I learn the most,” Baker said. “What 1 do is try to accept as many invitations to student events as 1 can. I will also meet with any faculty member who wants to see me.” “He does have an open-door policy,” Arvidson said. “If a student comes in to see him and he isn’t busy, he will invite them in.” A few years ago Baker tried maintaining a weekly walk-in hour, “but it really didn’t work out, because students and faculty with problems came in trying to get the president to solve them. But he’s not involved with the day-to-day operations and doesn’t have time to solve problems that can be helped elsewhere.” Arvidson and Baker go over his calendar regularly to prioritize it, determining who he can see and what events he can attend. “He likes to meet with students. He enjoys them and has good rapport with them. He especially likes to meet with groups when they invite him.” Baker receives many invitations from groups and tries to alternate those he accepts each year so that he can meet with as many different groups as possible. He also meets with ASI, the Poly Royal Board and the Academic Senate on a regular basis, but even those meetings are subject to his busy traveling schedule. Baker travels every month to meetings with the California State University Board of Trustees, the CSU Presidents’ Executive Council, and the National Science Council, to which he was appointed by President Reagan. Before his appointment to the NSC, he held an appointed position on the Board for International Food and Agriculture Development. By policy, he can only maintain one presidential appointment at a time. In addition to these regular meetings. Baker travels to meet with many other organizations. This month he is going to Dallas That’s why there are numbers on every ticket, so we can account for everyone who comes in.” Rodkey said his father first opened the Sunset Drive-In in 1950. He remembers it was raining heavily outside the night it opened, and they had it filled, with a line all the way from the box office to Higuera Street. ‘‘There used to be a time when owning a drive-in was fun, but not anymore” Rodkey said. ‘‘If it wasn’t for the swap meet here on Sunday, I probably wouldn’t be in business. People just don’t come out to the drive-in like they used to.” •The Cal Poly art and design department is sponsoring a presentation of assemblage sculpture by Mary Ann Bonjorni today through June 9.

If it saves one guy’s life, it’s worth it.’’ Though Lambert endorses Tipsy Taxi, he said, “1 unfortunately think the whole program is a preventative maintenance type program.’’ He said students tend not to use preventative maintenance until it is too late and then wish they had it. Lambert said he hopes the Tipsy Taxi coupon books will be kept at fraternity and sorority houses to be used when necessary. He said that even though sororities don’t have parties at their houses, they should purchase coupon books to take to parties. Hall strongly urges other fraternities to support the Tipsy Taxi program to prove themselves responsible hosts. Burris would like to get additional funding from local bars. Some of the bars do not even buy the coupon books, he said. “We’re trying to work with them,’’ Burris said. Osos Street Subs and Tortilla Flats have bought coupon books. So has McLintock’s Saloon, whose owner John Bushnell is president of the Business Improvement Association. Champions and Rose and Crown pub have tbeir own taxi programs. Bob Speicher, owner of Spike’s Place, said he would rather regulate from within. “We police ourselves pretty well,’’ he said. “We don’t have (people driving home drunk) here that much.’’ He said people usually go to places other than Spike’s to get drunk. “The basics of the (Tipsy Taxi) program are OK, but it seems like a Band-Aid type of thing,’’ Speicher said. The recently reopened Graduate would like to get involved in the Tipsy Taxi program, said general manager Charles DeGroot. Currently, the Graduate will get a taxi for someone who refuses to pay for a cab but is too drunk to drive. Bull’s Tavern doesn’t pay for the cab, but they will take a drunk customer’s car keys away and call a cab for him, said bartender Joe Eifter.",
