    "article_text": "With only seven players able to play Saturday night against U.C. Riverside, the Cal Poly basketball team knew from the start that too many fouls could destroy all hopes of victory. The Lady Mustangs’ roster dropped to seven last week after junior center Stacy Rooney was declared academically ineligible. Yet with almost three minutes remaining in the game and Cal Poly ahead, 65-64, four out of the five Lady Mustangs on the floor had four fouls. And sophomore Russia Madden, who fouled out, was watching helplessly from the bench. “I told them, ‘Keep your defense aggressive, but be smart,’ ” said head coach Jill Or-rock.

One of them, Maurice Pullum, a junior guard from Chicago, is the fifth best scorer in the C.C.A.A. with a 17.8 average. Cal Poly senior guard Jeff Gray held him to six points. “Jeff did a great job of denying Pullum the ball,’’ said Beason. “Pullum is one of Riverside’s key offensive weapons and when you shut him down, you take a lot away from Riverside’s offense.’’ The game started slowly, with both teams playing strong defense and forcing each other to use most of the 45-second shot clock.
