    "article_text": "Nuclear power:\tthe Price- Anderson Congressional Act limits a nuclear plant’s liablility in case of an accident — no other industry gets this limitation — and nuclear power plants are built and run by government subsidized monopolies; violates my first four laws, sometimes the fifth and sixth. Water: federal, state and local governments first subsidize water projects then sell the water below market rates, both preventing private companies from becoming involved in supplying water and resulting in huge amounts of “cheap” water to be wasted; also violates laws 1-4, and sometimes S and 6 with dam and underground projects. Offshore oil: leases of federal waters, the property of U.S. citizens, sometimes is below market rates, without the consent of a majority of citizens or results in significant air or water pollution; violates laws 1-3,5 and 6. By combining the environmentalism fo the ‘60s and ‘70s with the economic realities of the ‘80s, a new coalition of business and property owners, fiscal conservatives and environmentalists can carry the concept of of Environomics on into the 1990s and beyond in a cooperative manner that will resolve many of the environmental and economic issues facing us today. The idea that the economy and the environment are inseperable should be no suprise. Nearly all of what we put into the economy comes out of the natural environment. The natural environment is huge compared to the size or number of people, meaning, (with the exception of a few very toxic substances), that it takes huge, economically-expensive efforts to change it. Also, most pollution is simply waste that hurts the economies of polluted areas. So, can a person of the ‘80s be oriented toward a more economically prosperous future and not feel guilty about neglecting the environment we live in? Yes, by understanding the concept of Environomics and working together for a better future. Ron Bearce is currently writing a book entitled Environomics. He is the director of the Concerned Citizens of SLO County.",
