    "article_text": "With 5,000 gallons of milk and over 400 pounds of cheese being processed every week, the Cal Poly Dairy Processing Plant is certainly a busy little place. The plant is operated by 25 students, 23 are Dairy Manufacturing majors, and supervised by two foremen and one general manager. The plant handles all the Foundation’s milk and byproducts, fills orders from Williams Brothers markets, and stocks the shelves of the campus store. The students work part-time between classes, and have weekends off. Their typical day begins t 6 a.m., but Mondays they must report to work by 4:30 a.m. \"By 2 o’clock you are nodding off in your classes,\" according to Randall Dei, one of the foremen of the plant. Dei will be graduating next fall and has a job this summer working for Lucky’s Fluid Milk Plant, but for now he spends most of his time helping to oversee operations of the Cal Poly plant. Monday, Wednesday and Friday the plant is in full operation processing fluid milk. “After the milk comes down from the dairy it is stored in stainless steel tanks which hold 2,000 gallons of milk,” Dei said. The milk is picked up from the dairy every other day. “The cheese is vacuum sealed. This keps the air out«and gives the product a longer shelf life,” Dei said. Milk cheese is cured for three months, medium cheddar is cured four to six months, and sharp cheddar is cured six months. The curing rooms are huge walk-in coolers, their shelves stocked. All the products produced at the plant are product tested at the plant’s own lab. “Everything is state regulated, so you have to keep on top of it,” Dei explained. “Everyone who works here is pretty responsible, everyone pitches in,” he added. “We are a pretty busy little place,” said Dei. “Our pricing must be comparable to that of commercial dairies, because we compete in the same market. “We have to rely on our name and quality.” wouldn’t have signed up for the minor. ’Thrfact that it can help me career-wise is just a fringe beneftt,” said Hand.",
