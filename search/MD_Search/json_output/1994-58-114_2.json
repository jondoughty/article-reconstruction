    "article_text": "DETROIT — Dr. Jack Kevorkian was acquitted Monday of breaking Michigan’s assisted suicide law after a jury concluded he was only trying to help a gravely ill man end his suffering, not cause his death. After the verdict, the 65-year-old retired pathologist challenged doctors who have secretly supported his cmsade to go public. “I know there are doctors who want to come forward,” Kevorkian said. “I want this intimidation by medical politicians to stop.” Kevorkian also said he is still receiving letters from sick people who want his help, but refused to say whether he would resume his assisted suicide practice any time soon. “I think this opens the floodgates for Jack Kevorkian,” said Lynn Mills of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue.
