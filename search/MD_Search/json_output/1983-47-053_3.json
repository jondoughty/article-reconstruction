    "article_text": "People Generating Energy and The Media Project present Bonnie Raitt and Jesse Colin Young in an acoustic performance at the Fremont Theatre at 7 pjn. on Sunday, Feb.6. Lights and sound for the “We Don’t Need Diablo” concert will be powei^ entirely by the sun. Bonnie Raitt and Jesse Colin Young have actively supported People Generating Energy (P.G.E.) in their opposition to the Diablo Canyon ‘nuclear power plant. The musicians are donating their time and energy to the benefit concert because they firmly believe nuclear power is intolerable and unnecessary. Their support over the past six years at rallies and concerts has helped P.G.E. promote alternative energies. Said Bonnie Raitt in an interview, “Stopping nuclei power is not just another cause; it’s a necessity.” The performers’ musical talent and their strong conunitment to social justice and the environment has placed them among this decade’s top recording artists. Bonnie Raitt’s new band and her eighth album, “Greenlight”, have been greeted with much enthusiasm. I’ve been trying to find a way to combine my musical career with interest in bringing about political change,” said Raitt. Solar Genny One, a mobile electric generator which will provide lights and sound for the concert, was designed and built by Solarwest Electric in Santa Barbara. Genny One is owned and operated by two national solar advocacy groups, ’The Solar Lobby and the Center for Renewable Resources based in Santa Monica. The two groups sponsor The Media Project to educate people on how they can use solar energy and conservation. The unit generates all its electricity from sunlight. ’The electricity is stored in batteries and converted to AC power. Concert proceeds will be to continue educating and organizing the conununity on the dangers inherent in the use of nuclear power and the beneficial use of alternative energies. 'Tickets for the acoustic-solar concert are $11 and are on sale at Boo Boo Records, Cheap Thrills, Steve’s Bromeliads in Ba3rwood Park, and the People Generating Energy office at 452 Higuera St. For more information caU 543-8402 or 543-6614. Mismanagement, design flaws, poor construction practices and the expenses inherent in nuclear power have driven the cost of the plant up to 93 billion from an original figure of 9315 million, according to P.G.AE. “With electrical demand dropping, unprecedented conservation by consumers, reserve margiiu about 15 percent over accepted levels, and the cost of the plant going aky high, the riectridty from Diablo Cimyon would be proliibitively expensive and unnecessary,” said Manny Mansbach, a spokesperson for People Generating Energy. “Promisee of power too che^i to meter have proven totally imtrue.” According to the Wall St. Journal (Aug. 11, 1982), rate increasee of 20 peroent-60 percent have been commonplace in other areas of the country where nuclear plants have recently gone into the rats bass. 17» Edison Electric Institute recently reported that peak s\\umner risctrical use, a key measure of power demand, has gone down for the first time in nearly 40 years, leaving the industry with a surplus generating capacity of 38.7 percent, t^ highest since 1938. i Fresh lemondade will be sold at the Lemonstration.
