    "article_text": "If Ronald Reagan is serious about cutting the nation's defense spending he ought to consider using the Cal Poly men’s basketball team as an inexpensive deterrent to nuclear attack. In twenty minutes of action during Friday night's CCAA opener against UC Riverside, the Mustangs’ 1-2-2 zone allowed just two field goals and limited the Highlanders to fifteen percent shooting. But, just when it looked like a blow-out the Highlanders put on an all-out frontal attack. Using a full-court press, UCR scored the first ten points of the second half to cut Poly's lead to 26-18. A quick Poly time-out cooled off the visitors and the Mustang lead got no smaller than six points as Ernie Wheeler's troops held off UCR for a 46-37 win. While UCR was shooting fifteen percent in the first half. Poly wasn’t much better (thirty-three percent!. In fact, UCR outshot Poly for the game — 38.1 to 37.8. The scoring difference came in the free throw department where the Mustangs outscored the Highlanders 18-5. Most of those came late in the game. ' There was very little hope, if any at all, for the Cal Poly women’s basketball team to vqpset No. 1 nationally ranked Cal Poly Pomona Saturday night down south in California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) activity. So the Mustangs concentrated their collective efforts in upsetting UC-Uverside Friday evening in the CCAA opener for both teams. The Highlanders entered the contest ranked No. 8 in the nation in Division II. The girls talked all week about beating- Riverside. They knew they had a chance; and weren’t just kidding themselves into believing they had a chance. But, it wasn’t to be. The Highlanders, who led 40-34 at intermission, held off every Mustang second-half charge en route to a 77-69 win. Saturday night at Pomona, Poly went 0-2 in the CCAA standings as the Broncos whipped the visitors^ 93-47.",
