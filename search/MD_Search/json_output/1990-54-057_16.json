    "article_text": "Cal Poly’s Plant Operations was honored Friday with a “Thank You” party for building new offices for the Public Safety Department. “They did such a good job we just decided that we would thank them,” said Richard C. Brug, director of Public Safety. These new administrative offices, adjacent to the firc/police station, will house the director of Public Safety, a conference room, a lab and clerical offices. The existing police station is scheduled to be remodeled, leaving more room for the police and parking officals. Dispatch has been moved to the back of the old building, enabling the front olTice to be dedicated entirely to parking and non-emergency business. The new offices give Public Safety more room for equipment and personnel. It also enables staff members to have their own offices, thus avoiding the unproductive overcrowding that has been prevalent. The front counter is entirely staffed by students and will be open Mondays through Fridays Sec NF.W OFFICES, page 8",
