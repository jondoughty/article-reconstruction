    "article_text": "embrace both sides of the conflict, and in so doing it has fractured along ideological lines. Questions have been raised about Aquino’s leadership ability. She has been accused of being naive, aloof and unable to deal with the insurgency. Tensions have built to the point where Enrile and his supporters are said to be planning a .military coup. General Fidel Ramos, Aquino’s chief of staff, met with Enrile and other commanders in an effort to discourage any coup attempt. Then, last Thursday, the Philippines most prominent leftist labor leader, Rolando Olalia, was brutally murdered in Manila. The leftists have blamed his murder on the military and vowed to carry out a series of nationwide strikes. A nearly completed cease-fire agreement between the rebels and the army has been scuttled. Mao Zedong once said that power comes out of the barrel of a gun, and the world has seen little to disprove this claim. In the Philippines, the greedy guns of the left and right are poised to steal power from a vast majority of innocent people. Communism and fascism are different in theory, but similar in practice. Under both ideologies, people cannot be trusted with freedom. poverty. Their track record in Southeast Asia leaves much to be desired; the Khmer Rouge simply wiped out 3 million Cambodians, and Vietnam and North Korea have been transformed into human beehives. It is not likely that a Philippine communist state would be any different. Could Enrile do any better? If the military were to take control, conditions would not necessarily improve. Military men are notoriously bad at running a national economy, and in the Philippines economic power is at the heart of the struggle. How would Enrile rid the Philippines of the Communist infestation? It’s more difficult than spraying for ants. Any disaffected peasant is a potential communist, and it’s not as if all communists have red spots on their foreheads. Enrile would likely mire the Philippines in a prolonged Argentina-style “dirty war’’ complete with death squads and thousands of disappearances. In the midst of this crisis, the silence from Washington has been deafening. The Reagan administration, hopelessly caught in Iranian intrigue, seems to be ignoring the Philippine crisis. This is a grave mistake. The administration needs to engage in an intensive diplomatic effort — public and private — to hold together Aquino’s fragile coalition and prevent a military coup. Aquino is far from perfect, but at this point she represents the best hope for the Philippines and the United States. As President Reagan is fond of saying, “If not us — who? If not now — when?” Editor — I find it very disturbing that a pathetic man iike Waiiy George has become a cuit hero among young coilege-aged maies. i suppose there is potentiai humor to be found in his performance on a certain conservative caricature levei, sort of iike Ronaid Reagan meets Don Rickies, if that sort of thing appeais to you. But there is nothing funny in vicious attacks on AiDS victims and minority groups, no matter how strong your feeiings might be politicaliy. The aura of hate and in-toierance that surrounds this man is simpiy sick, it’s unfortunate and disappointing to see so much intei-iectuai regression on a university campus. What's next, a Ku Kiux Kian raiiy? SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea showed its “great leader,” President Kim II Sung, on television Tuesday while ignoring reports in rival South Korea that Kim died or was embroiled in a serious power struggle. A Defense Ministry spokesman in Seoul acknowledged North Korean news media reports that Kim was alive and added: “We are closely watching whether these developments in the North have resulted from a serious internal power struggle or its (the North’s) high-level psychological warfare hiding a sinister plot for military provocation.” An Asian diplomat in Pyongyang, reached by The Associated Press by telephone from Peking, said he saw the 74-year-old Kim at Pyongyang Airport on Tuesday “and he is in absolutely good health.” The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added: “Everything is all right in this country, the situation is absolutely normal. ... There seems to be nothing correct about these reports (of an assassination or power seizure). ... It is absolutely normal, there is nothing wrong. He is absolutely normal, he is in good health.” We have been busy all year selecting'the Very Finest Collection of Gifts y OrnamentSy DecorationSy Pottery y Gift BookSy Stuped AnimalSy Gift Calendars and Delightful Stocking Stuffers just for You.
