    "article_text": "As a youngster, Jack Algeo lived on a cattle ranch in eastern San Diego. Today, Jack Algeo is the head of the animal science and industry department at Cal Poly. \"It’s interesting to come back to the university after having years of experience in the industry under your belt,” Algeo said. ‘Tve spent most of my working life in the industry (animal science) doing work in 11 western states,” he said. Algeo’s first job was teaching animal science and nutrition at Cal Poly in 1949. Algeo graduated from Washington State with a master’s degree in Animal Science Nutrition and a bachelor’s degree in Animal Science. Before returning to Cal Poly about four years ago, Algeo worked in the animal science industry in many capacities. He worked as a resident nutritionist for a Santa Maria company, where he was responsible for livestock nutrition and research. He said people in this company were innovators in the mechanized feeding of livestock. From there he opened his own consulting firm working as an animal scientist in nutrition. Algeo then decided to sell his firm and return to Cal Poly after taking “a 30-year sabbatical.” Algeo said the animal science and industry department at Cal Poly is unequaled by any in the country.",
