Projections by the ARD television network gave Kohl’s Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, 44.3 percent of the vote. The business-oriented Free Democrats, junior party in the coalition government, were projected to win 8.4 percent of the vote. The opposition Social Democrats were projected to receive 37.6 percent of the vote. It was reckoned that the anti-NATO Greens party would pick up 8.2 percent of the vote. ARD first projections are based on the returns from 17 representative districts across the country, officials said.",
