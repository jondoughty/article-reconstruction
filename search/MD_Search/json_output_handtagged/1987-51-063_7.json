    "article_text": "Editor — In reference to Jane Gumerlock’s column, “Learning for the sake of learning” (Jan. 22), I must agree with her assertion that many students lose sight of the significance of their educations in their struggles to graduate. I, too, know many students who just want to get school out of the way so they may pursue their careers. Four years ago when I was a freshman, I also felt anger at the “casual\" student and wrote a letter to the Daily along the lines of Gumerlock's column. However, I no longer feel angry with those who are bored with classes and resent teachers. I simply shrug and accept them and realize that no amount of my wishing that students will “learn for the sake of learning” will alter these people. At 22 years of age. I’m sure of very little, but I'm reasonably certain that some people enjoy learning and others simply don’t — it’s just part of one’s nature. Polytechnic schools and impatience to begin careers don’t breed casual students. Hell, I remember classmates in kindergarten who were bored in school, who didn’t like to learn. I’ve known them in primary school, in junior high school, and high school. I still know them today in college. It’s hard for me to accept, but some people, whether due to family values, societal.values, or a host of other complex influences, don’t like to learn and don’t like school. This is not to say such students don’t do well in school. Enjoying the learning process and performing well in it aren’t necessarily related, and often conflict. So, instead of lamenting a lack of truly enthusiastic students as Gumerlock does, I place “learning for learning’s sake\" in the category of “seldom-acquired traits\" and wish those well who don’t enjoy what I’ve found to be the pleasures and enrichments of learning and intellectual growth. As for my path through education, “I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\"",
