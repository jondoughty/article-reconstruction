    "article_text": "With the possibility of rain on Saturday dominating weather reports, local agriculturists and weather watchers are hoping to see the start of the accumulation of the area’s December average of four inches of precipitation. “Historically, our rain starts in December. Heavy months are usually January and February,” said Ron Munds, member of the San Luis Obispo Water Conservation Council. The current drought has been a shock to Munds. When he moved into town in 1972, he said it rained buckets. TV)day, as the area enters its sixth year of drought, Munds said he can hardly remember what green is. Munds said the area’s rainfall was less than one inch in November. Normal rainfall for November is 2.7 inches. Average rainfall figures were computed from statistics from 1970 to 1990. “Obviously, W’e’re substantially behind. Unless we have a major change in our weather pattern, we’ll be in serious trouble. It seems our high pressure is not breaking down and is drifting north of us,” Munds said. Jim Greil, a professor in the crop science department, said, “Statistically, the odds are g(x)d for normal rainfall, but I certainly don’t have a crystal ball.” Greil said the weather has been fairly cooperative for the growers of the county’s main cash crop — wine grapes. Without rain or frost appearing at unfortunate times of the season to damage wine grape crops, wine growers are looking to produce one of their best wines this year. “The yields are still good and the quality is good, but the big problem is the availability of water,” Greil said. As the wine grapes are currently in a dormant period, further rainfall will not affect them. However, there is concern for the area’s leaf lettuce, strawberry, broccoli, cauliflower and brussel sprout crops. Greil said if rain isn’t dropped upon these fields soon, “well be in a bad way.”",
