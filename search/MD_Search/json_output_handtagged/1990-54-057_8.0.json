    "article_text": "A human resource management conference scheduled for Friday is the senior project of three Cal Poly business majors. Christopher Bradbury, John Butler and Tracy Westnedge, who felt the business department needed a more specialized seminar, planned “The New Age of Human Resource Management” conference. The conference is sponsored by the School of Business, and will take place Feb. 2, from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Shore Cliff Lodge in Pismo Beach. Human resource management “is a growing field, and it’s going to be more important in the next decade,” said Westnedge. “We want to make it a little bit more well known.” Working in the Alumni Relations Office, the students began the project in September by searching the data base of more than 8,000 business alumni to find panelists experienced in personnel or resource management departmants of large- or medium-sized companies. Other experts were found through acquaintances and inquiries. More than 100 students, businessmen and local representatives are expected to turn out for the event. “It’s generating quite a bit of interest on and off campus,” said Stephen L. Hughes, from alumni relations for the School of Business. Several banks and local agencies are also planning to send teams to the conference. If the senior project is sue Sec CONFERENCE, page 8 cessfui, it may become an annual event, said Hughes. The HRM concentration is still relatively new and small,” said Bradbury. “And 1 think it was important to bring these businessmen to students, and also to inform other business students what the concentration is about.” Free to all students, the conference focuses on personnel relations and will feature three keynote speakers and six panel discussions, led by Cal Poly alumni and businesspeople from throughout California. Jan Duffy, professor of business law at Cal Poly, will discuss legal issues in the 1990s. Harry Wilson, vice president of administration in the Applied Technology Division of Litton Industries, will examine cor- porate restructuring. James Linhart, district sales manager in Southern California for Eastman Kodak, will cover the history and potential of human resource management. Workshop topics will include innovative benefits for the 1990s; office politics:\tmanaging the workplace; employee stress; how to get the most out of employees; the legalities of hiring and firing; and the growing pains of expanding businesses. Conference participants will include representatives from San Luis Obispo County, Dart Marketing Associates, Seagate Technology, Sun Microsystems and J.C. Penney. The final day to sign up is Wednesday in the Dean’s Office, located in the Business Administration and Education Building",
