    "article_text": "Dennis Nulman, associate dean for the School of Professional Studies and Education, said the recent interest in teaching is because of the availability of jobs in the field and a recent state-mandated minimum entry-level salary of about $20,000 a year. “Both the teachers’ union and the state itself anticipate a big shortage of teachers about five years down the road,’’ said Nulman. “The baby boomers are having children which will create a need for more teachers. Even here in San Luis Obispo there’s talk of reopening schools that have been closed down.’’ Nulman said his department received 1,200 applications for 400 incoming freshman spots in the undergraduate program and 255 applications for 113 spots in graduate studies. “We increased by 43 percent for fall 1986 from the year before,’’ said Nulman. “Teaching has gained in status and become more desirable,’’ he added. “Two or three years ago you could just walk in and get a spot (in the department). It’s more popular than ever before.’’ A positive result of the demand for spots in the program is that the quality of teachers will improve, said Nulman. “The old idea that anybody who wants to be a teacher can be is a bunch of baloney. Not everybody who wants to be a doctor becomes a doctor.’’ According to Nulman, the department received 270 applications for 39 spots in the liberal studies program for fall 1986, and the minimum GPA See TEACHERS, page 3 was 3.53. Though students used to enter college as liberal studies majors until they decided on another major, Nulman said they now have an internal waiting list to get into the liberal studies program. “The increased enrollment allocation by the university can’t keep up with the new demand,” said Nulman. “The university is under pressure to create more openings, but it will be a gradual increase.” The colleges can’t generate teachers quickly enough to meet the demand, Nulman said, so the districts are hiring teachers from out of state and out of the country, as well as people without their credentials on an intern basis. He added this is quite common in urban areas, where the shortage has the greatest impact. “I’m real positive about opportunities for teachers in coming years,’’ said Nulman, “especially for high school level science teachers. They can write their own tickets.” Obispo County line. “With four 5uys covering a county and a lalf, we’re just scraping the surface,’’ said Fuhrmann. During the recent election, President Reagan signed a bill vhich grants amnesty to illegal iliens who have been in the rountry since 1982, and allows them to apply for legal immigration. Applicants will have' six months to get proof of their residence, and 12 months to file for the immigration process. For the moment, said Fuhrmann, the border patrol is awaiting directions from Washington, D.C., before apprehending any further suspects. The San Luis Obispo office, which began operation in 1968, is located on the west side of Highway 101 between Los Osos Valley and Madonna Roads. Fuhrmann has been working at the office since 1970, and had previously spent five years patrolling the Texas-Mexican border. The local border patrol is a federal agency under the U.S. Justice Department, and is one of several backup stations in California which pick up illegal aliens who slip past stations at the Mexican border and in San Clemente. Some of these aliens work in town in restaurants and factories, said Fuhrmann, but “the majority are in labor-intensive agricultural areas, such as Santa Maria and Guadalupe.’’ In general, the border patrol checks out calls and complaints about alleged illegal aliens by driving right to a job site in marked cars and uniforms, and talking to suspects. “We get a lot of information from disgruntled or layed-off employees,”\texplained Fuhrmann. Most of these employees have been replaced by illegals who are happy to earn in an hour here what they would work all day for in Mexico. Once at a job site, agents ask suspected illegals for identification or immigration documents, and arrest those 10 to IS a day who are without them, said Fuhrmann. They can also make customs and drug enforcement arrests, he added. Some of the illegal aliens try to run and hide, Fuhrmann said.",
