    "article_text": "When asked to give his views on the disruptions caused by more than 300 students on Murray Street Oct. 27, Darryl Gutiarez, a senior math student, said, “Well, I don’t care. I don’t live there.” This comment is, however, not surprising. In fact, 98 percent of San Luis Obispo students, those not directly involved with the disruptions, feel the same way. It is impor-tant to understand See ASI, page 8 From page 2 that this attitude is part of the problem. “Something has got to change,” states SLO Police Chief Jim Gardiner. He believes it is going to come down to “peer responsibility.” Yes, it is true that only 2 percent of the students are causing the bulk of the problems. Yet, it is the others — the ones standing around just letting these events happen — who are also at fault. “Peer pressure” is a much stronger defense against these disruptions then anything the police force can put together. ASI Community Relations Coordinator Marc Fowler suggests that students “take an active role in helping stifle such events before they get started.” Get to know your neighbors. Tell them when you are planning a party, and, by all means, don’t let the party get out of hand. “Police yourselves,” Fowler continues, “Have some respect for your neighbors.” ASI is putting a lot of effort into improving the relationship between the students and the community. Events such as Neighborh(X)d Cooperation Week are put on so the rifl between students and the community can be mended. ASI is not condemning parties or drinking. We are condemning the disrespect some of our students have for the community and the police department. Please, be part of the solution, not part of the problem.",
