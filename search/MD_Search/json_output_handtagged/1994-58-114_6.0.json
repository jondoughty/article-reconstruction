    "article_text": "Celebrating the achievements of students with disabilities is the purpose planners say is behind today’s Disabled Awareness Day. “We’re really going for broke this year,” said architecture graduate student Michael Shannon, publicity chair for the event. “We want to set the precedent for new things in the future. We’re tired of just a token celebration of disabilities. We are going to have a lot of activities going on.” The theme for this year’s Awareness Day is “The Seven Intelligences.” Diane Dempwolf, a staff development coordinator at the Oxnard School District, will speak on the theory by Harvard University professor Howard Gardner, who says people inherently have seven intelligent ways of learning. “It’s not just the traditional verbal and linguistic approach to learning taught in college,” Shannon said. The theory fits well into the message which DSS and the students it serves say they are trying to get across. “We all have different abilities and skills that we’re good at,” said Chris Parker-Kennedy, a Deaf Services Specialist with DSS. “With Awareness Day, we’re trying to promote all the ways people can be talented.” DSS Coordinator Harriet Clendenen said Awareness Day also will help increase awareness in the campus community. “It gives (students with disabilities) an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities,” Clendenen said. As part of Awareness Day, Disabled Student Services has speakers, videos, displays and paintings. Landscape architecture junior Leo Simone, one of the coordinators of Awareness Day, said panel discussions also will be held regarding how people view disabilities.",
