    "article_text": "If a dark-brown haired, hazeleyed girl quotes a few excerpts from Hamlet or Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, and in the same breath says she’s 14 years old, it’s not April Fools’ Day. Christ! Jones, a 5’2” resident of Grover City, began classes at Cal Poly this quarter without receiving a high school diploma. Exhibiting intelligence beyond her junior high school peers, Jones and her mother began a “home school’’ where she studied an average of eight hours per day in her home. Before then, Jones attended public schools through seventh grade, but like many other students, grew bored with the environment. The lack of academic challenge left her unsatisfied with her formal education. Eventually a Cal Poly admissions officer heard of her situation and, with his help, Jones found herself at Cal Poly. Jones accepted Cal Poly’s invitation to attend because “of their genuine interest in the students’ welfare,’’ she said. “Cal Poly was interested in my ability to get an education, and the food was amazingly good.’’ Having spent most of her life around adults and feeling less comfortable with children her own age put quite a strain on Jones. “It was almost as though there were two me’s,” she said. .At home, however, her mother could match subject matter with her level of understanding. “I could be me, a whole person,’’ Jones said. When she was younger, she completed the standard I.Q. tests, but the results weren’t revealed until many years later. Jones said she believes this was because of the faculty’s unjustified perception that her parents would push her too hard. Jones considered going to continuation school to earn her high school diploma until she discovered it was only an option available for those 16 years and older. Although test results placed her at a post-high school level, she would be unable to accumulate the necessary credits for a diploma. Advised to proceed in her education with an organization for children like herself called Gifted and Talented Education, Jones seemed to have hit a dead end. Once the media got wind of Jones’ situation, Dave Snyder, Cal Poly admissions officer, called Jones and offered her his support. With the completion of a SAT test with a score 70 points See JONES, page 7 higher than freshman entrance requirements, combined with work approved by faculty members, Jones was allowed to enroll at Cal Poly. Jones likes music and the works of Shakespeare and Hawthorne, but said she is no more intelligent than the average person, “just a little more motivated.” She was so motivated she attended class with her mother at Santa Barbara Business College. After that — her first college class: “I knew that’s what I wanted,’’ she said. Her first quarter here began with a schedule of five classes. So far, she said, “I love the atmosphere. I feel very comfortable.’’ She has made several friends already. Some know how old she is, she said, and others don’t, but they don’t treat her any differently. “I am happy to be with people who care about learning. They aren’t here because it’s required.’’",
