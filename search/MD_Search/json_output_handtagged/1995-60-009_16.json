    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — A low-fat diet substantially slowed the growth of prostate cancer in a laboratory experiment and researchers say the findings suggest eating lean could become a key part of treating the disease. Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York found that human prostate cancer tumors grew only half as fast in mice eating diets with about 21 percent fat as in those eating diets with about 40 percent fat — the level eaten by many American men. A report on the study will appear Wednesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. “What we found was astonishing to us,” Dr. William R. Fair of Sloan-Kettering said TViesday. “TVunors didn’t disappear, but the decrease in growth was really impressive.” Prostate cancer generally is slow growing, said Fair, and if it can be slowed even more “then it is possible that many men wouldn’t need anything more than dietary manipulation.” Most prostate cancers develop around the age of 60, said Fair, and “if we are able to a tell a 60-year-old that he could do something to slow growth of the cancer for 30 years, that’s the same as a cure for most men.” In the mouse study. Fair and his colleagues ii\\jected human róstate cancer cells into special aboratory mice that can grow human cancers. The mice, at the time, were being fed a com oil diet that included 40.5 percent fat, about the same fat content in the diet of the average American male adult. Once the prostate cancer tumors started growing in the mice, the animals were divided into four groups and each group started receiving different levels of fat, ranging from a high o( 40.5 percent to a low of 2.3 percent fat per calorie. After 11 weeks, the mice were killed and tumor growth was measured. Blood chemistry from the animals was also compared. Himor growth was 2^2 times greater in mice on the high-fat ffiet than for mice on the lowest-fat diet. For mice on a 21.2 percent fat diet, the tumor growth was about half that of the mice on the highest-fat diet. Fair said the difference also was reflected in tested levels of prostate specific antigen, or PSA, in the rodents’ blood. High levels of PSA are often indicative of cancer growth. Mice on the leanest diet had PSA counts about 35 percent of the level of mice on the high-fat diets. Dr. J. Michael Gaxiano and Dr. Charles H. Hennekens, both of Harvard Medical School, said in a Journal editorial that the findings “have contributed important and relevant data to an emerging body of evidence on dietary fat and risk of prostate cancer.” They said the studies raise the possibility that diet can play a role in both the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer, but warned that the findings have to be verified in human clinical trials.",
