    "article_text": "PENSACOLA, Fla. — With her roof still leaking Tuesday, two months after Hurricane Erin, Lisa Rosen didn’t plan to stick around for Opal as the season’s ninth hurricane headed toward the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Erin tore off most of the roof from Rosen’s beachfront home. Plastic sheeting still flapped thunderously in the wind as a squall hit Itiesday. The house is livable but it leaks like mad,” said Rosen. It can’t take another beating, and I sure don’t want to be around to witness it.” Rosen and her 7-year-old daughter rode out Erin at a hotel in Pensacola. For Opal they made a reservation farther inland, in Atlanta. This could very well be the worst system of the year for us,” said state meteorologist Mike Rucker in Tallahassee. A hurricane watch extended from Morgan City, La., eastward across the Florida Panhandle to the mouth of the Suwannee River on Florida’s northwest Gulf Coast. Opal had passed over Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, killing at least 10 people and leaving 20 missing, and causing flooding that drove more than 20,000 people from their homes in Campeche state. By late Tiesday afternoon it was centered about 380 miles south-southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River, with maximum sustained wind about 100 mph, and its moisture had spread into the northeast-central Gulf Coast region. It already had caused coastal flooding in southern Texas. Workers were evacuated from offshore drilling rigs near Alabama’s Dauphin Island and elsewhere along the coast as gusty thunderstorms moved in. Residents of low-lying areas of far southern Louisiana also headed to higher ground. An abundance of caution is needed,” said Clyde Giordono,",
