    "article_text": "A former Cal Poly civil and environmental engineering professor died Monday night after a two-year battle with leukemia. Yugoslavia-born Dragoslav Misic began his career at Cal Poly 21 years ago. He retired from teaching this fall and died in French Hospital Medical Center one week after being admitted. One of Misic’s colleagues, professor Harold Cota, said Misic contributed greatly to the department. “He was responsible for the development of the water pollution control class in the department, and that is quite a unique accomplishment,” Cota said. Misic had been in and out of the hospital for the past two years, and Cota said the therapy appeared to be helping. “Last year he was all ready to teach fall classes,” Cota said. Cota said Misic appreciated the support and generosity the Cal Poly faculty displayed during his illness. Every faculty member has a certain number of sick days available to them and Misic needed more than those allotted, Cota said. Faculty members from many departments on campus, even those Misic did not know personally, had contributed their sick days so he could receive pay during his prolonged illness. Cota said Misic was touched by their contributions. “He was very well-liked by the Cal Poly community,” Cota said. “He was a very friendly and optimistic person. Even down to the very last ...he was optimistic.” Misic is survived by his wife, Mira, and two children. His son attends medical school in Chicago and his daughter is in the sixth grade at a local junior high school. There will be two services held in his memory — one in Chicago and another on Saturday, Nov. 9 at 1 p.m. at the United Methodist Church. Cota said former students, faculty and colleagues will establish a scholarship in Misic’s memory.",
