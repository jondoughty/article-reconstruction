    "article_text": "Story Donn Morris feels that punkers are stereotyped. The 21-year-old journalism major is what society has labeled a â€˜punker.â€ But Morris doesnâ€™t feel he's a punker. â€œ1 call myself the average Cal Poly journalism student,\" he said. Morris sports a â€˜â€˜mohawkâ€™â€™ type haircut and wears layered clothing typical of the 50â€™s. He doesnâ€™t wear dazzling earrings on his earlobes, nor does he wear tattered T-shirts that most everyone typecasts as what a punker should wear But still, Morrisâ€™ appearances have shocked some people and have even caused others to take action against him. When Morris came to Cal Poly four years ago, he said he looked like â€˜â€˜yoiir average regular high school student who was becoming a freshman â€ Soon after entering Cal Poly, Morris went through a transformation in his life. â€˜â€˜1 donâ€™t know whether it has to do with dorm-life breeding, though the one I was in was a zoo,â€ he said. \"College turned out to be the whole difference High school was a sort of incubation period. In high school you basically knew everyone, you led a very stable lifestyle. Then in college, you hear all the myths about the different people, and you're out there living with them-itâ€™s different,â€ Morris said. One of the major differences in Morrisâ€™ life was the style of music he began listening to. 1 was into every band in high school-Zeppelin, Van Halen, Aerosmith and Journey to name a few.â€ He said. Mainly I was listening to them because everyone else was listening to them. Then a few bands caught my ear and I really liked what 1 was listening to.â€ He began to listen to bands such as the Sex Pistols These hands, who were labeled punk rock, approached world concerns and questioned society. â€œThey were addressing these problems, whereas the others were still singing about the same old stuff-all about love and how my baby left me and how I got my baby back,â€ Morris said. Soon after discovering these bands, Morrisâ€™ life was transformed. He got his haircut and slowly began to dress â€œdifferently from others.â€ He recalls, â€œWhen I showed up at Cal Poly, 1 got the haircut. 1 could count the number of people who looked like me on two fingers.\" After the change in his lifestyle, Morris noticed a change in the attitudes of people on and off campus. Everyone just started staring at me as though 1- was a stranger. 1 donâ€™t think 1 was any different. 1 wasn't out to say screw youâ€™ Iâ€™m going to look different. â€œIt just pleases me, \" he said. I wasnâ€™t out to make any type of statement like â€˜Well, here 1 am,â€™ wasnâ€™t trying to please anyone but me. 1 liked it. It pleases me. Before I try to please or displease anyone,â€”Iâ€™m going tp please me. â€ Morris said. He began to notice people stereotyping him. 1 couldnâ€™t understand why. When 1 first got the haircut and the clothes, people were very vocal. 1 couldnâ€™t understand why. Theyâ€™d say things like â€˜you godamn punker,â€™â€™â€™ he said. â€œI just couldnâ€™t figure that out. If I was walking down the street and saw the strangest person on the earth, I donâ€™t think I would start calling them names.â€ Morris said he found many people who thought of his lifestyle as \"wild and crazy.â€ You really get a lot of hypocritical analogy-stuff like punkers beat people up is one of the major stereotypes,â€ he said, 1 can't say that it's not all true, but a lot of it isn't.â€ Morris recalls a time when a member from a motorcycle gang came up to him and began â€œscreaming in my ear about what he thought of me.â€ â€œ He added, \"Iâ€™ve been pushed around because of the way I look, but my reaction to it is to act like it never happened. People are expecting a reaction- that I am going to fight back.â€ The number of people who have changed their lifestyle to that of a punker's has grown. Whether it's a fad or fashion, Morris doesnâ€™t know. type of thing.â€ Because of his punk-lifestyle, Morris knows people view him differently. He knows that when he does start looking for a job things will be different. If I were to work on a newspaper or such. Iâ€™m sure I would have to look the way a journalist is supposed to look,â€ he said. It depends on the individual. I donâ€™t dislike what people do...itâ€™s their lifestyle,â€ he said. People are seeing things out there, and some of them are there just foUowing-the-leader He added, â€œIâ€™d be just as comfortable dressing in that way. Iâ€™ll still think the same, I realize that. I have even had instructors who have gone out of their way to tell me that I may have to conform. I lead a lifestyle, but Iâ€™ll have to conform to the dress.â€ \"Most employers want to hire a nice, responsible person, and I guess responsible goes into the looks and dress,â€™â€™ Morris said. Although people think Morris seems strange because of his lifestyle, he said, \"I donâ€™t feel at all like a revolutionistâ€”though I 've been blasted by a lot of people because of the way I look. People think Iâ€™m strange, but I just think they look stranger, he add- ' ed. Iâ€™m not saying that what everyone elM is doing is wrong, but I donâ€™t think that what Iâ€™m doing is wrong either.â€",
