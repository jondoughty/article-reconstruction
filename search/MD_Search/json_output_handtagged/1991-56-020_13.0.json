    "article_text": "The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states, “A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” At the time this was written ‘militia’ referred to every able-bodied man. U.S. Code, Title 10, section 31 states that the militia of each state includes “all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and...under 45...” In 1788, John Adams argued that “anns in the hands of citizens may be used at individual discretion.” Gun control has no direct relation to crime rates. The four nations with the highest per capita gun ownership have some of the lowest crime rates (Switzerland, Israel, Denmark, and Finland). Britain has very restrictive gun control laws, however between 1960-75 their homicide rate doubled. Between 1930-75 the U.S. rate only rose 30 percent. In Jamaica, ownership of a single bullet is punishable by life in prison, however in 1980 Jamaica had 6 times as many gun deaths as Washington, D.C.(one of the most violent U.S. cities per capita). Gun registration is useless. In 1968 the Supreme Court ruled that criminals couldn’t be compelled to register their weapons because to do so would infringe on their Fifth Amendment right against selfincrimination! A 1985 Justice Department study showed that only 21 percent of felons’ handguns were obtained through retail channels. The millions of dollars and thousands of man hours used for background checks would be better spent prosecuting and punishing those responsible for 80 percent of our crime problem — career criminals. The FBI states \"murder is primarily a societal problem over which law enforcement has little or no control.” This problem exists independently of firearms. Assuming all firearms could be removed from society, crime would still continue. Gun control laws affect only law abiding citizens. They are the only ones that will obey them. If a criminal used a gun in a drive-by shooting, would he be likely to worry about such a minor law as illegal possession of a firearm? I hardly think so. Firearms do not create violence. It is a permanent part of society. To remove a person’s ability to defend against violence is a moral outrage. Every human has the right to self-preservation and for some that defense is a firearm. No other means of defense is as effective. Proponents of gun control would like you to believe that cops in general are for gun control. WRONG! The National Sheriffs’ Association states, “There is no valid evidence whatsoever to indicate that depriving law-abiding American citizens of the right to own arms would in any way lessen crime or criminal activity.” The National Police Officers’ Association of America: “We feel that an American citizen of voting age and good character should have the right to purchase without restriction a handgun, pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, or like item without interference by a government body.” Patrick Henry said, “The great object is that every man be armed ... Everyone who is able may have a gun.” It is obvious that our Founding Fathers knew the value of personal, unrestricted gun ownership. Without it there would be no United States. The Second Amendment gives an explicit right for firearm ownership by private citizens. Even ignoring that right, the societal gains of private ownership far outweigh the costs. With or without firearms the insane will continue to disrupt our society. There is no way to eliminate them. Jack the Ripper and Jeffrey Dahmer are two prime examples. Fourteen people died in the Oakland Hills fire. If a match started it, should we ban matches? Effective enforcement of gun bans is impossible. Irrational fears will not stop criminals from prejang on society. However, gun control will certainly stop honest citizens from defending themselves from dishonest, armed criminals. Gun control is harmful only to the honest. When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.",
