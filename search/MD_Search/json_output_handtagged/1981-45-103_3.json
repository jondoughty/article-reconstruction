    "article_text": "When C^fornia State Sen. H.L. Richardson Jr. first entered politics, he found tliat politicians don’t care about beM solutions. “Money and Politics in California” was the title of the address given by the 25th District Republican senator from Arcadia. A former advertising and pt^lk relations executive, Richardson has been identified with conservative politics over the years. Politicians don’t give a damn about what’s best — they go into politics to force their ideas on others.” Richardson told an audience of about 80 people in the University Union’s Room 220 Thursday morn^. Intellectual pursuits are not a part of politics. It’s a battle, and I soon learned to play ball within those re-quirements.” Richardson maintained that there are five major myths of politics and listed them as: —\tPolitical daeitioHt arc eompromiccM. According to Richardson, those decisions are conflicU and the sUte senate is not a reflective body, as it diould be. —\tPotitieiaiu art clactad by a majority. ’The senator hold that voters dact politicians, and the majority of eligible voters don’t vote. —\tPoUtieiant arc “twccty-cwccty\" people. Richard-*8on said the politicians he’s dealt with are people who get what they want. —\tLegislators read everything they vote on. He said they read perhaps a third of what they vote on, and voting on 20 bills with one vote is not uncommon. —\tTalking with a politician will change his or her mind. “It all boils down to thejact that the legislatUve process we have today is the worst way to solve problems,” said the senator. \"To say a state senator can represent 6,0(X) people is stupid.” According to Rkhiudson, C^fornia would be bdter off if lawmakers were part-time politicians who worked with citizens to reach solutions. Richardson stated kis conclusion and opened the floor to questions. Cal Poly poliHical science professor David George began a question regarding the Second Amendment and Richardson, founder a^ chairman of Gun Owners of America and Gun Owners of California, said loudly, “I will not disctiss the Second Amendment!” Mambws of the audience responded by firing repeated questions at the senator about his stance on gun owner-riiip. Taking the idea of personal freedoms a step further, a young man asked the speaker how he felt about abortion, gay rights, and marijuana. liet me take a homosexual,” Richardson l>egan. What 1 mean is, let me discuss that first.” Me explained that he was not interested in dictating a homosexual's lifestyle, but. does not believe they should be allowed to teach children or hold most other jobs. Regarding abortion, he said he l)S|,d been in com-municatioh with members of the medical community who all maintained life l>egins at conception. “So, 1 believe abortion is killing,” he stated. Richardson's opinion on marijuana was that it is debilitating, harmful, and he opposed its use. “Rut an adult who chooses to .screw up his body should have that right, as long as he isn't hurting others,” he added.'“It all gets down to infringement of others' rights. You can swing your arm all you want to, until it reaches my nose.\"",
