    "article_text": "It was in February of this year that the world witnessed the miracle of “People Power” and Corazon Aquino’s revolution in the Philippines. I shall not soon forget the TV images of nuns throwing themselves in front of tanks. But now, nine months later, the miracle is rapidly dying. The fighting has not stopped, and Aquino finds herself in a baptism of fire. The Philippine nation is now more polarized than ever, with a Communist rebellion continuing unabated. Aquino hurt the Communists by getting rid of their rallying point:\tFerdinand Marcos. Perhaps she hoped that the rebels would lay down their arms, but they have in fact intensified the brutality of their attacks, especially in the cities. Communist-backed labor unions have subjected the fragile Philippine • economy to a number of strikes and work stoppages. All this has angered the military in general, and Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile in particular. Enrile wants to unleash more military power to finally end two decades of Communist subversion. But Aquino is holding back. She believes that the general source of the Communist revolution is the tremendous inequity and poverty in the Philippines, which she is trying to correct. She would like to see the rebels re-integrated into the government, and she made a point of pardoning several jailed Communist leaders after her inauguration. This put her at odds with Enrile and the military almost immediately. Aquino’s cabinet attempted to embrace both sides of the conflict, and in so doing it has fractured along ideological lines. Questions have been raised about Aquino’s leadership ability. She has been accused of being naive, aloof and unable to deal with the insurgency. Tensions have built to the point where Enrile and his supporters are said to be planning a .military coup. General Fidel Ramos, Aquino’s chief of staff, met with Enrile and other commanders in an effort to discourage any coup attempt. Then, last Thursday, the Philippines most prominent leftist labor leader, Rolando Olalia, was brutally murdered in Manila. The leftists have blamed his murder on the military and vowed to carry out a series of nationwide strikes. A nearly completed cease-fire agreement between the rebels and the army has been scuttled. Mao Zedong once said that power comes out of the barrel of a gun, and the world has seen little to disprove this claim. In the Philippines, the greedy guns of the left and right are poised to steal power from a vast majority of innocent people. Communism and fascism are different in theory, but similar in practice. Under both ideologies, people cannot be trusted with freedom. The communists feed on poverty. Their track record in Southeast Asia leaves much to be desired; the Khmer Rouge simply wiped out 3 million Cambodians, and Vietnam and North Korea have been transformed into human beehives. It is not likely that a Philippine communist state would be any different. Could Enrile do any better? If the military were to take control, conditions would not necessarily improve. Military men are notoriously bad at running a national economy, and in the Philippines economic power is at the heart of the struggle. How would Enrile rid the Philippines of the Communist infestation? It’s more difficult than spraying for ants. Any disaffected peasant is a potential communist, and it’s not as if all communists have red spots on their foreheads. Enrile would likely mire the Philippines in a prolonged Argentina-style “dirty war’’ complete with death squads and thousands of disappearances. In the midst of this crisis, the silence from Washington has been deafening. The Reagan administration, hopelessly caught in Iranian intrigue, seems to be ignoring the Philippine crisis. This is a grave mistake. The administration needs to engage in an intensive diplomatic effort — public and private — to hold together Aquino’s fragile coalition and prevent a military coup. Aquino is far from perfect, but at this point she represents the best hope for the Philippines and the United States. As President Reagan is fond of saying, “If not us — who? If not now — when?”",
