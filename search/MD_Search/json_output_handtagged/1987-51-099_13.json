    "article_text": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) — President Reagan, in his first major speech on the health crisis, said Wednesday that local schools and parents must decide how to educate children on the threat of AIDS but also must stress morality and avoid a “value neutral” approach. “All the vaccines and medications in the world won’t change one basic truth — that prevention is better than cure,” Reagan told the Philadelphia College of Physicians, one of the nation’s oldest professional medical associations. “We’ve declared AIDS public health enemy No. 1,” the president said. And he pledged, “I’m determined we’ll find a cure for AIDS ... we’ll find a way or make one.” Supporting statements by Education Secretary William Bennett, he also said the dissemination of such information “must be up to the schools and the parents, not government.” Until now, the administration’s principal spokesman on the issue has been Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. He has taken a more aggressive stance than Bennett, saying that beyond abstinence, the surest protection is the use of condoms and the education of children as early as the third grade. But Reagan also told reporters that he doesn’t quarrel with Koop’s advice on prevention. Asked earlier if people should “just say no,” Reagan replied, “That’s a pretty good answer. Yes.” AIDS,\tor\tacquired\timmune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious,\tfatal\tdisease\tthat at- tacks the body’s immune system, redering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. In most cases it is\tspread\tby sexual contact,\tand\thealth\tofficials estimate that between 1 million and 1.5 million Americans have been exposed to the virus. While the president has spoken on the AIDS issue before — requesting Koop last Feb. 5 to undertake a study of the problem — he has been largely silent on the issue of giving advice to Americans on preventive and protective measures. In his speech, Reagan noted that the Public Health Service has issued an information and education plan to help control the spread of the disease, which has no known cure. “But let’s be honest with ourselves,” the president continued. “AIDS information cannot be what some call ‘value neutral.’ After all, when it comes to preventing AIDS, don’t medicine and morality teach the same lessons?”",
