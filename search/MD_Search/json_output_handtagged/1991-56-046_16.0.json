    "article_text": "Franceska Gleason should think out her reasoning a bit more clearly before she spouts familiar pro-abortion rhetoric and attaches her name to it. The “Constitutional right” that protects a mother’s choice to kill her unborn child should not be equated with the freedom of speech or freedom of religion. The decision Roe v. Wade is a highly controversial one and has not stood the test of time that the freedoms guaranteed in the Bill of Rights have. Ms. Gleason argues that a mother is “here and now” and an unborn child “being of the future” does not really count and is not deserving of the same basic rights. Each of us was “unborn” at one time. Each of us spent nine vulnerable months in our mother’s womb. Each of us was given a chance to live. Pro-life groups are dedicated to the belief that all children deserve this chance. Finally, you do not have to be a “religious fanatic” to be pro-life, as Ms. Gleason would suggest. You simply must have a sense of compassion for all humanity and a willingness to speak out for those who have no voice of their own.",
