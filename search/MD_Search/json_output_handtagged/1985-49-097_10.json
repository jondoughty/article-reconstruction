His specialty, spe^h research, includes the study of high-speed processing of speech information by machines. Jim Harris, “•Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department head, called the the grant “unusual” because is was given to someone who is currently a teacher, rather than a potential instructor.

A spokesman for Chevron Corp. said the company felt the grant proposal showed promise for helping to maintain the quality of the graduates it hires and that in order to get good students U is necessary to retain a good faculty. Stanhope earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and electrical engineering from Cal Poly in 1968 and a master’s degree in electrical' engineering from the University of Southern California in 1973. From 1968 to 1979 he worked for Texas Instruments Inc. and remains as a consultant to that company and other electronic firms. ^ Since he joined the Cal Poly faculty in 1979, Stanhope has been involved primarily with junior-l^vel curriculum.
