    "article_text": "WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) — Newspaper heiress Patty Hearst Shaw says she’s not sure whether President Reagan’s recent expression of interest in her request for a pardon means one will be forthcoming. I don’t know,’’ she said during a brief interview Monday with The Advocate of Stamford at her Westport home. “It’s a little premature for anything like that. If he (Reagan) doesn’t approve it, it would go to the next administration.’’ Shaw, granddaughter of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, last August quietly asked for a pardon for her role in the 1974 robbery of a bank. She has maintained she was brainwashed by the radical Symbionese Liberation Army, a group of self-styled revolutionaries who abducted her in Berkeley, February 1974.",
