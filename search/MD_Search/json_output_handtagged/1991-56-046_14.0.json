    "article_text": "1 am a Christian white male ilepublican in the middle class. That makes me one of the most hated people on campus! 1 would like to respond to Fran-ceska Gleason’s commentary (Dec. 4) regarding the “silent majority” and abortion rights. Ms. Gleason mentioned several times the idea of constitutional rights to privacy. I feel many people who flippantly use this term have never read the constitution because no such rights exist. It is a myth. If a child is being molested in the apartment next door to mine and I do nothing about it because I respect the right to privacy of the child molester, then I would be considered by most to be partially guilty of the crime. It would be ludicrous to not at least call the police. What claim then, do abortion rights activists have on such a right if child molesters do not? The fetus is referred to by Ms. Gleason as a group of cells. Did you ever stop to think that all of us are a group of cells. You just have quite a few more than a fetus. Also, the DNA chains which define every person as a unique individual are all in place from the moment of conception. I agree that a woman has the every right to control her body, but the fetus in her is not part of that body and the majority of the doctors in this nation would agree with me. The last of Ms. Gleason’s points that I would like to address is the idea that women will have abortions whether they are legal or not. If society was to follow that line of logic, then we might as well build motels that supply contraceptives and sanitary conditions where men could take the women that they intend to rape. Rape would be safer for both parties involved since although rape is illegal, it takes place anyway. I am pro-choice. I believe that all women have the right to ch(x)se whether or not to reproduce, but that choice has to be made before you get into bed with that special somebody and not after you get pregnant.",
