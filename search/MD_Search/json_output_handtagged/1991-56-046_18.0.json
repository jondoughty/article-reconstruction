    "article_text": "Awhile back. Mustang Daily promised that their editorial board would get mustang tattoos on their butts if more than 10,000 students turned out to vote in the recent elections. 10,367 students voted. You made the promise. We paid the price. It’s tattoo time. Of course, there may be some flexibility in the choice and design of the tattoos; we think a gerbil would be very appropriate for Peter Hartlaub. Y)U made the bribe. We paid the price. It’s tattoo time. And certainly the editorial board would agree that the students deserve to see irrefutable evidence of your fulfillment of this obligation. Certainly there is enough room on the front page for a few small photos... You made the deal. Now give us our due. It’s tattoo time.",
