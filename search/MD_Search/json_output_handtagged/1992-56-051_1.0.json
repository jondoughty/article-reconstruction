    "article_text": "The morning of Nov. 1 is like none other throughout the year, at least out at the Horse Unit’s Breeding Barn. On this day, the barn is overrun by a slew of camped-out students, making the stone-floored building look more like a BASS ticket center than Cal Poly’s equine reproduction unit. But the tickets these students are waiting for aren’t for any concert, but for the chance to enroll as one of 45 students in Animal Science 131, Beginning Western Riding. “I thought I was going to be the only one out there at 3 o’clock, but there was already a line by the time I got to the bam,” said Jamie Ramirez, a home economics senior, thinking back on that cold morning. The class, only offered during winter quarter, fills up each year, despite a $150 lab fee. Instructors Roger Hunt and Gene Armstrong have more than 45 years of combined experience teaching and working with horses. This class has three sections, Tuesday and Thursday from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m. to noon; Monday, Wednesday, Friday 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.; and Monday, Wednesday, Friday 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The three-unit class includes a textbook, homework assignments and hands-on experience. “A lot of people do things for money,” said Armstrong, a 1966 Cal Poly animal science graduate. “But this is something I like to do. I’ve been around horses all of my life. I can never remember not being around livestock. “Beginning Western Riding provides the opportunity to gain horse experience, which can be used in other animal science classes or just for pleasure,” Armstrong said. The class teaches beginners and those with limited experience techniques for grooming, riding skills, care and feed-Scc RIDING CLASS, page 8 ing plus an understanding of thr time and financial commitment required when owning a horse. Along with the lab fee, stu dents are required to have :i riding helmet and their own health insurance. Having youi own tack (a saddle and riding pads) is recommended because the ones the horses come with aren’t in the best condition, Armstrong said. The horses come from Ken nedy Meadows Pack Station near Lake Isabella in Southern California. Through classes at Cal Poly the horses are fed, vaccinated and exercised. The costs are greatly minimized by having students perform many of these tasks. Armstrong said everyone benefits from the arrangement — Kennedy Meadows, the horses and the students in the riding class and in animal science classes. “This class is not just for beginners. There are different horses with different temper-ments and different people with different temperments too, and it’s good experience learning how to work with all kinds,” Armstrong said. Safety, the top priority Horses and riders are matched up for two weeks according to skill. Then the riders are switched to give experience handling different horses. Armstrong said there have not been any serious accidents because the safety aspect of the class is strictly enforced. Before anyone gets on a horse, the Cal Poly fire department speaks to the class about safety. Armstrong emphasized that safety working with horses is a must. Concerns about safety among other animal science instructors is high. Students who work with livestock and especially horses must keep in mind that being safe and being informed is important, he said. Armstrong said this class is for everyone and anyone who wishes to work with horses any time in their life either for pleasure or for a career. Reasons for popularity Horseback riding is the number-one pleasure industry, both in numbers of pteople involved and in number of dollars, Armstrong said. Riding horses gives a sense of therapy, both physical and mental, said Armstrong. Students take this class for a number of different reasons, he said. Some take it because they want to work in the horse industry, others for the horse experience or just for the pleasure of working with horses. “I’ve always been interested in horses. This is my last quarter here at Cal Poly, and I wanted to able to enjoy this class while I can,” said John Scott, a civil engineering senior. Armstrong said, “You have to be honest with horses. They deserve your resptect. They’re sensitive, gentle and kind. If you think you’re pretty tough, a horse will make you think about that one more time.” As an instructor, Armstrong says the greatest feeling of satisfaction comes from seeing a student develop a love for horses. “It appears like something deep inside of them was moved when it happens.”",
