    "article_text": "Days before local hearings to decide whether the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant will be fired up for low-power testing, an attorney for plant opponents on campus Thursday assailed PG&E's nuclear track record and questioned credibility of the utility’s pronouncements. Speaking in UU 112, W. Andrew Baldwin, the lawyer representing the legal intervenors in Utigation cqncerning the plant’s security system, said the pubUc is caught between two sides on the issue of Diablo Canyon’s safety. “PG'&E says the plant is safe, but can we believe them?” he said. In answer to his own question, Baldwin detailed several incidents which occurred during the utility’s attempts to build and operate five nuclear power plants in California since 1955. He also cited a court decision which found PG&E guilty of libeling a television documentary producer. Beginning with the VallMitos power plant near San Jose, Baldwin ran down a list of nuclear power projects undertaken by PG&E, all of which were found to be on or near earthquake faults. These included:^\t\" —a nuclear plant at Humboldt Bay, closed in 1975 for refueling and never reopened due to seismic hazards and leaking fuel. —the abortive Bolinas Bay plant, which was blocked by the Alo™<^ Energy Commission before construction began because of its proximity to the San Andreas fault. —a proposal to build a nuclear reactor at Point Avena, near Mendocino in northern California, which was also halted, Baldwin said, by the U.S. Geological Survey when it discovered PG&E was withholding seismic data indicating the presence of an earthquake fault. —the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power plant, located two and a half miles from the Hosgri fault, which Baldwin said PG&E knew about in 1971, but did not inform the Nuclw Regulatory Commission until 1973. ’The Humboldt Bay power station was the subject of a KNBC-’TV, Los Angeles-produced documentary titled The Powers ’That Be,” which explored the issue of furi problems and seismic safety of the plant. After the show was aired, PG&E officials drew up a letter accusing th^ocumentary’s producer of secretly taping a utility offi<^ on the subject of the safety of the furi at the plant, Baldwin said. ’The note said the produced taped the remarks clandestinely, then edited the film to make it appear that the official was speaking on camera. Baldwin said.\t^ ’The letter, according to Baldwin was sent to congressmen, goverorhent agencies and the Atomic Energ^y Commission among other places, and the producer sued for libel, claiming his reputation would be damaged.' Under questioning during the trial, the PG&E official who made the accusations admitted he had indeed made the contentious remarks on the record. Baldwin said a jury found that PG&E did libel the producer and awarded him S7 million in damages. An appeals court found that amount excessive, however, and a settlement in lower court netted him 1400,000.\t^ 'The former legal director for the San Francisco-basbd Friends of the Earth, said PG&E’s motivation in this incident was to prevent further showings of this documentary, which they felt was \"full of innuendoes, half truths, and biased.” 'The lawyer, who has worked for the San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace and other legal intervenors for over two years, also read from PG&E documents instructions concerning the screening and destruction of files to prevent detrimental information about the utility’s activities from becoming public. A PG&E representative was at the talk, but refused to comment on Baldwin’s remarks for the record. He also declined to give his name to a reporter.",
