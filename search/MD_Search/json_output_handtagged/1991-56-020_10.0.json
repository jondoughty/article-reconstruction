    "article_text": "There is new help for people suffering from eating disorders at Cal Poly. Kelly Moreno, a psychology and human development professor, is offering group therapy sessions for eating disorder patients beginning Thursday. The group sessions will be held during a class in group therapy counseling which is taught by Moreno to students seeking their master’s degrees in counseling psychology. Moreno’s hope is that the group will promote the recovery of clients as well as the ability of his students to work with eating disorder patients. “I wanted to run a live group so students could benefit,” Moreno said. Moreno said he wants to conduct the group so the patients’ needs take precedence. “Their needs and confidentiality come first. Teaching comes second,” Moreno said. Moreno said the patients will receive free group counseling — a service that would cost $20 to $30 on the private level — in exchange for being observed by use of a one-way mirror during his counseling class. Moreno feels Cal Poly, as well as the city of San Luis Obispo, are in desperate need of counseling services for people suffering from eating disorders. “If there wasn’t a need on campus, I wouldn’t be doing this,” Moreno said. “This whole community is understaffed,” Moreno said. “I can count the number of qualified professionals in the area on two fingers.” Jim Aiken, associate director of Psychological Services on campus, said Moreno’s work comes at a time when Elie Axelroth, a group therapy counselor of eating disordered patients for Psychological Services, is on a temporary leave from the university. The idea to run a group therapy program for both the benefit of his students and patients is a combination of Moreno’s learning experience and previous work in group counseling. Moreno’s idea stems from the work of psychologist Ervin Yalom, a famous Stanford University group counseling psychologist who originally demonstrated the benefits of group therapy. In addition, Moreno worked at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara where his medical director conducted a similar situation in which Moreno participated as a student learning group therapy. He said he hopes to run the group through spring quarter and ideally he would like to keep it running indefinitely. Group therapy is the best mode of counseling for people with eating disorders, Moreno said. Psychological Services offers counseling for depression, anxiety, interpersonal problems and — least frequently — eating disorders. Aiken said Psychological Services sees approximately 20 percent of the student population for counseling. He said 7 percent of those seen are eating disorder patients. Bulimics are more prevalently seen, he said. Anorexia patients are the rarest patients .seen since those suffering from this eating disorder usually require medical attention before they seek psychological help, Aiken said. Demographically, eating disorders affect mostly women, Moreno said. Only 3 to 5 percent of those affected are men, he said. Moreno said the highest-risk groups are athletes, dancers, models and sorority members. Fie said dietitians and nutrition students are also high-risk groups. “Just being female puts a person at risk,” Moreno said. Anorexia on campus is estimated to affect 5 percent of the female population, and 20 percent are estimated to suffer from bulimia, Moreno said. Moreno believes these statistics are low. Moreno came to Cal Poly last year as a lecturer and is now a full-time professor. Anyone interested in participating in the group therapy program should call Moreno at 756-2033.",
