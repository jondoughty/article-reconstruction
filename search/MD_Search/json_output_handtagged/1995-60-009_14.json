    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Hitting Congress in its pocketbook, President Clinton vetoed the legislative branch budget Hies-day and told lawmakers he wouldn’t budge imtil they make concessions on a larger spending Though the Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich said in a joint statement. The White House said Clinton supported the bill and its cuts, but vetoed it as a sign of his frustration over the slow progress of budget deliberations. fiscal year began feud Issuing the third veto of his presidency, Clinton rejected a measure that would let Congress spend $2.2 billion this fiscal year — a $200 million reduction from last year’s budget. The move opened Clinton to attack from Republicans. *President Clinton has put politics ahead of cutting govern- providing money for military ment spending,” Senate Majority construction projects, including Sunday, only two of 13 spending bills have passed Congress. ”I don’t think Congress shovild take care of its own business before it takes care of the people’s business,” Clinton said in his veto message. In another move aimed at putting Republicans on the defensive, Clinton approved a bill family housing. The approval came despite the measure’s inclusion of $70 million in projects Clinton said amounted to wasteful GOP spending and pointed up the need for a line-item veto. Both actions carried political risks for Clinton. In the latest round of political gamesmanship over the budget, the president actually approv^ one bill he said wasted taxpayers’ money and vetoed another that would cut government spending — a bill he said he liked. Clinton’s action and the GOP response were the latest tit-for-tat in a war between the White House and Republicans over spending priorities, especially on Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. The president has threatened to veto eight of the 13 spending bills. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston said Clinton had “no substantive grounds for a veto” of the congressional budget. *The president can’t have it both ways,\" said Livingston, R-La. “He can’t lecture the Congress on political reform while vetoing the first real effort in 40 years to reform the Congress.” White House aides said the veto carried out a threat Clinton made weeks ago, hoping that it would make Congress look like the selfish party in the budget debate. Approving the military bill gave the president a chance to push again for the line-item veto. Clinton said the $70 million in military projects approved by Congress — but not requested by the Pentagon — illustrate why: “The taxpayers’ deserve protection from this kind of wasteful spending.” Republicans made passage of the line-item veto a key part of their campaign “Contract With America” last year. While the House and Senate have passed different versions, negotiators have not yet developed a compromise measure. Democrats contend that the Republicans don’t want to give Clinton that power.",
