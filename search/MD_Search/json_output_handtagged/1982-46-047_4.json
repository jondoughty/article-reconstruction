Bessie Swanson said that although the proposal was made only last month, she hoped a major would be implemented because “it is valuable to the university.” A bachelor of arts degree would be offered if the major is adopted. The main rationale for a music major. said Swanson, is \"Cal Poly is a university. By definition, a university' is an institution of higher education where students, in addition to specialized studies in a particular professional field, should expect to enhance their preparation for life as educated persons, she said. The objective is achieved by participating as a member of a campus community that includes the intellectual, social and aesthetic elements of an educated society, as well as by enrolling in courses appropriate to the student s interest and ability ’ In order for the Music Department to keep up its quality group performances, students are needed who can devote a lot of time to their music, according to Swanson.

In a survey conducted by the Cal Poly Music Department, 182 college-age students in the area over the past 10 years have either gone to other schools which offer majors in music or gone into other majors because Od Poly does not offer one in music. This campus is a loser in that respect,” Swanson added. In order to implement a nfusic major, the proposal must be ^iproved by the administrative officials both <m campus and at the chancelkw’s office, said Swanson. The curriculum for the noajor must also be submitted and approved. A curriculum is also being developed for the proposed major, said Swan son.
