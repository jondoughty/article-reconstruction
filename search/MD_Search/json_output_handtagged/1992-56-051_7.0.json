    "article_text": "The Fine Arts Committee is a subcommittee of the ASI Program Board and has been See ASI, page 7 Cal Poly’s Status of Women Committee is seeking applicants to work as volunteer advocates for sexual harassment and sexual assault survivors. Wendy Demko Reynoso, a member of the Status of Women Committee, said the committee felt there was a need for more than just the sexual harassment advisers now available. “Right now there are only advisers, and it’s not their role to encourage or take sides,” she said. Nan Byars, an engineering technology professor and cochairperson of the Status of Women Committee, said the advocate job is quite different from that of the sexual harassment adviser in that the advocate does take a side. “An adviser has to stay neutral in a case,” Byars said. “All an adviser can do is tell survivors what their options are. Clearly someone who has gone through something like sexual harassment or assault is going to need support. That is what the advocate is for, to be supportive.” Byars said advocates will accompany survivors to meetings and hearings, and be there for them when they need someone to listen. “We’re looking for people who have the time to help out, and who are knowledgeable ed>out sexual harassment and sensitive to the issue,” Byars said. “Mostly, we are looking for caring people who can be sensitive and supportive.” Byars said the committee is looking for men and women to be advocates because sexual harassment and assault happens to both males and females. Though no fixed number has been set, Byars said the program will probably need 10 to 12 volunteers. Byars added that the committee is interested in faculty and staff members only. “Students pass through the school quickly. They’re not here for very long,” she said. “What we want for the program is continuity. We need people who will stay.” Advocates will go through a training program to prepare them for their job, Byars said. “We’re not going to just throw them in and tell them to go help somebody,” she said. “We will train them.” Reynoso said the committee wants the volunteers to undergo the same training as advisers. The number of advocates who will be allowed to go through the adviser training is one of the things still being ironed out, she said. Volunteer advocates’ names and phone numbers will be added to sexual harassment flyers that are given to people who are seeking help for harassment problems. Survivors can then call an advocate if they feel they need help or support. Reynoso said she hopes anyone who comes forward with a problem will be encouraged to call. Reynoso said the advocate program will probably be ready to put in place by spring quarter. Interested faculty and staff members should contact the Academic Senate office. active for more than 20 years. In the past, the committee has hosted art exhibits and invited poets, coffee house musicians, storytellers and theater groups to campus. The purpose of the committee is to bring artists and musicians of all kinds to perform for students at Cal Poly. The experience gives students an opportunity to interact with professionals and improve the social life on campus. Committee members negotiate contracts with agents over the phone which gives them a chance to fine tune their communication skills and business strategy. The committee is made up of student volunteers who choose events that they think will enhance the creative and diverse entertainment that is part of a university campus. The committee is a bridge to the necessary resources needed to assist anyone interested in successfully bringing fine art events to Cal Poly.
