    "article_text": "Editor — I find it very disturbing that a pathetic man iike Waiiy George has become a cuit hero among young coilege-aged maies. i suppose there is potentiai humor to be found in his performance on a certain conservative caricature levei, sort of iike Ronaid Reagan meets Don Rickies, if that sort of thing appeais to you. But there is nothing funny in vicious attacks on AiDS victims and minority groups, no matter how strong your feeiings might be politicaliy. The aura of hate and in-toierance that surrounds this man is simpiy sick, it’s unfortunate and disappointing to see so much intei-iectuai regression on a university campus. What's next, a Ku Kiux Kian raiiy? Mustang Daily encourages readers’ opinions. Letters should .be submitted to Room 226 of the Graphic Arts Building.",
