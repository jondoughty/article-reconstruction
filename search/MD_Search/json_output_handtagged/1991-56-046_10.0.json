    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The removal from a federal building of a nude sculpture, criticized as a “shrine to pedophiles,” has drawn charges of censorship from members of the art community and the sculptor himself. The General Services Administration placed the sculpture of a nude woman and a baby gjrl in storage after Rep. Edward R. Roybal, D-Calif., whom the building will be named after, criticized the artwork by Tom Ottemess for being sexually explicit. “A lot of jjeople in the arts community are really upset about this,” said Adofo V. Nodal, general manager of the city’s Cultural Affairs Department. Museum of Contemporary Art Director Richard Koshalek and Associate Director Sherri Geldin issued a joint statement Wednesday denouncing the removal and urging a public hearing of the artist’s views. An attorney for Otterness, who was in Germany Wednesday at an exhibition, said the artist hopes to work with the government to restore his work. “Tom was extremely upset and disappointed at the actions taken without any prior notice or respect for his artistic and legal rights,” attorney Henry Welt said.

The work showed a woman squatting and a baby girl lying on her back, legs open and up, holding a globe. Both show genitals and are typical of Otterness’ nude figures. The figures were the central element of a $266,000 work called “The New World,” whose However, the untested law exempts “works for hire.” It is unclear whether the sculpture would be construed as “work for hire” and whether works commissioned by the federal government are covered by the law. “But his goal...is to see his work displayed in the public space for which it was created,” Welt said.",
