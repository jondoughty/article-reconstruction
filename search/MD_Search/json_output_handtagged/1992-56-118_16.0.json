    "article_text": "The Cal Poly College Republicans heard about “Civil Rights Awareness Week” two weeks ago. We have been working with U.S. Civil Rights Commissioner Bill Allen on his bid for U.S. Senate. We (the College Republicans) decided that this would be a great opportunity to offer our contribution to, what we believed to be, a national civil rights week. We had no idea that “Civil Rights Awareness Week” was an exclusive event to Cal Poly. We talked to Bill Allen and he agreed to come talk in San Luis Obispo. On Tuesday, May 5, Davin Pascale (President of the Committee for Civil Rights Awareness) contacted a member of my club demanding that we remove the flyers and publicly apologize for “misusing” the Civil Rights Awareness Week name. I have twice left messages with Miss Pascale hoping to clear up this obvious misunderstanding but she has refused to return my calls and has filed a complaint to the school without talking to me first. Tb my dismay, the day after Miss Pascale ordered us to take down our flyers I observed that the flyers had been torn down for us. Not only is this action a violation of state election laws, but it seems to be a personal attack with partisan motives behind it. If there was any misunderstanding about the motives of our actions I sincerely apologize. But it deeply disturbs me that a chartered campus club is not allowed to participate in a campus activity. If we knew that we were supposed to get permission we would have done so. We received nothing in our club box mentioning this fact nor mentioning the event itself.",
