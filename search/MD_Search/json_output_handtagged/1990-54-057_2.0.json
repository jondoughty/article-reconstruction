    "article_text": "Should the Commencement Committee bring an outside speaker to address the spring graduating class? Should the ceremony be split into two separate ones? The Commencement Committee wants to know what students think about spring commencement. Meetings are now being held to decide things such as who the speakers will be and if there will be multiple ceremonies. Kim Waltrip and Jamie Howard were elected by the Executive Committee of Associated Students, Inc. last quarter to voice student opinions on the graduation ceremony. “We act as sort of go-betweens between the Commencement Committee and the student committees (of ASI),’’ said Howard. Bob Bostrom, chair of the Commencement Committee, said there were two ceremonies in December so students could get more tickets. “1 wanted to do away with the black market of graduation tickets,” said Bostrom. “Each student would get five graduation tickets. If you have two graduation ceremonies, you’ll get 10 tickets.” Last December’s commencement ceremonies had agriculture, engineering and science and math students graduating in the morning, while business, liberal arts, architecture and professional studies and education students graduated in the afternoon. President Warren Baker spoke at both ceremonies. Waltrip said she gets her ideas from students and friends, including her friends on the executive and academic committees of ASI. When Waltrip or Howard get suggestions, the ideas are presented to the executive committee and the commencement committee. If the ideas are agreed upon, they become part of the plans for spring commencement. Ideas may be submitted to Commencement Committee members or left in the ASI box located in Room 217 of the University Union.",
