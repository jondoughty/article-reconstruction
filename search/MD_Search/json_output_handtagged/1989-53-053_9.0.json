    "article_text": "Editor — Rarely do we have occasion to read the Daily twice before washing the windows with it. The Jan. 10 edition was an exception. Chris Thomas’ column “A dream is just a dream” required quite some thought and this response. Thomas clearly is an eloquent and intelligent person, and a good writer. Under the presumption of discussing Dr. King, he discusses integration as an escape from blackness, and a sign of insanity. He follows this with a call for action to create an independent black state/culture. I call upon him now, and all those who read his opinion, to carefully consider what he is saying and proposing. Consider the following: An independent black state seems like a good escape from too many years of abuse, humiliation, and discrimination. But, it is a regeneration and perpetuation of the same ignorance which created the state of \"blackness” today. It calls for conquest, separatism, the exclusion of other races from black culture, and depriving the rest of us of their input to our culture. This is quite clearly the oppv>site of what Dr. King would have proposed, and the opposite of what those who strive for equality would like to see. Not only is it a continuation of racism in a new form, it is the primary cause of failure in the fight for equality. It shares the same failure of the ERA and gay-rights movements. Each of these groups have worked toward their own liberation, failing to understand the concept \"equality.” Equality in the eyes of the law, and, more importantly, in our minds, must come to mean equality for human beings, regardless of their attributes. This is the equality which Dr. King wanted. The future along Thomas’ path would be one of conquest. counter-conquest, and counterconquest, continuing in a never-ending fashion as in the middle cast. The future along a path of equality is bleak at first, but comes out nice in the end. The bleakness comes out of the question of \"how?” How do we achieve change in the minds of bigots? Working together, all the oppressed and enlightened members of the oppressing groups, we can change the culture as a whole. As a function of time, this world will become one culture, as we are one creature. To become one culture, yours must admit that of mine, and mine must admit that of yours. If you choose to go your own way, excluding me (or vice-versa) how can we come together? Bigotry is borne of ignorance, of lack of knowledge of one another. Separatism perpetuates bigotry — see South Africa and its separate black nation states. To work toward distinct cultures based on the color of the skin (or any other attribute) is counter-productive and working toward everlasting hell. I hope that the views of Mr. Thomas are not that of the Afro-American Student Union. I hope they do not support separatism, counter-racism, and ignorance as he does. If they do, then they have a nice counterpart in the white bigot culture known as the KKK. Finally, Thomas gives halfhearted praise of Dr. King. His opinion was less a discussion of King than a discussion of his own fanaticism. King was clearly a great leader of our nation (not just one race), a man way ahead of his time. He was a man dedicated not to overcoming the white man, but rather to overcoming ignorance and discrimination. He believed in the goodness of the white man only as part of his belief in the goiKiness of mankind. He was a man who lived to improve his world rather than just to turn the tables. He lived by a philosophy of forgiveness, and love for mankind — in all its forms. King’s dream can be expressed as \"one world, one people.”",
