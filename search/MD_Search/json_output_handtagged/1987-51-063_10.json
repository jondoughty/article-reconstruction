    "article_text": "In the California Collegiate Athletic Association, emerging winless from a two-game home-stand is a no-no. After doing just that this past weekend, the Cal Poly basketball team finds itself in a position where the postseason tournament and playoffs may be a no-no. The losses — 75-56 to UC Riverside on Friday and 60-57 to Cal Poly Pomona on Saturday — dropped the Mustangs’ CCAA record to 2-3. Even more telling of the situation is that Poly has fallen into the bottom half of the standings. Only the top four teams are invited to the CCAA’s postseason tournament. “It hurts,’’ said Poly coach Steve Season. “In this conference, you have to win at home. We’ve really got to look for those wins next week. “I think I’ve made a realistic goal of making the top four but it’s going to be tough because there isn’t a weak team in this conference.’’ Poly found out Friday that when the Dynamic Duo is shut down, a not-so-dynamic ending is the result.

Parker and Jeff Gray led the way after intermission, as Poly cut the deficit to two. The Mustangs could not maintain the attack, however, as Riverside had its cushion back to eight points in little time. But instead of going off to the races, it was off to the free throw line.
