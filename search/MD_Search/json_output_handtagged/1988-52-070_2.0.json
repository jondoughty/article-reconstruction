    "article_text": "Berrett says finding stolen permits easy because cars are recognizable Stealing a parking permit or buying one from “some guy” may seem an innocuous crime and an easy way to beat the Cal Poly parking blues, but there’s a good chance of getting caught, said Detective Ray Berrett of the Cal Poly police department. The recovery last week of two stolen permits by campus police buttresses Berrett’s remark. One student was cited for possessing stolen property and released, and the other case is still being investigated for mitigating circumstances. Parking Officer Cindy Campbell said recovering two or three permits a week is not unusual. As many as six have been recovered in a single day. Berrett said “the student who is trying to save a few bucks by stealing a parking permit or buying one from some guy in the parking lot stands to lose a lot more.” Any car found displaying a permit that has been reported stolen will be towed at the owner’s expense. A citation for possessing stolen property will be issued to the person under whose name the car is registered. And the matter will go to the courts, where fines average $200. But how can a parking officer spot a stolen permit amid the thousands of cars parked on campus? Easy, says Berrett. “They recognize the cars out there,” he said. ‘‘Between themselves they can talk about cars that they’re having trouble with.” Campbell said, “We look for distinguishing marks. Let’s say it has a Mustang Village parking permit and then it has a staff permit. We’re probably gonna wonder why ... so we’ll do some checking into that.” It’s usually the “floater” permits, those that hang from a rearview mirror, that get stolen, Campbell said. If a stolen permit is spotted “on the bumper, there’s usually a story behind it: somebody’s reported it stolen and given it to a friend.” In January, more than half of the police reports filed were for stolen permits. The 21 thefts reported last month bring the total of stolen permits still outstanding to 93. The police record resulting from a petty theft arrest can be more costly than the fines levied, Berrett said. “A record can follow you,” especially someone hoping to work one day for a company that requires a security clearance, he said. Troubled that college students would be so petty as to steal parking permits, Berrett said “People need to look a little more toward the future.”",
