    "article_text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Despite some of the toughest anti-smoking laws in the nation, residents want even stronger restrictions on smokers, according to a California Poll published Monday. The poll found that most nonsmoking state residents are bothered when someone lights up. Whether they smoke or not, half of the people polled who live in California want smoking prohibited in airplanes. Large majorities favored restrictions on smoking in workplaces, hotels, restaurants and government buildings. “All of this is consistent with what we have said for years,” said Mark Pertschuk, executive director of the Berkeley-based Americans for Non-Smokers Rights. “The vast majority of people in California and the U.S. support limiting or completely eliminating smoking in places where people come together in enclosed places,” Pertschuk said. However, a different view was taken by Walker Merryman, vice president of the Washington-based Tobacco Institute, a major advocate of smokers’ rights. “I have to wonder if there is real sentiment for any further government intrusion or if smokers and nonsmokers are simply expressing their preferences without endorsing any further government action” to pro- hibit smoking, Merryman said. One of the first and toughest anti-smoking ordinances in California was passed in San Francisco in 1983. The poll, which was conducted April 3 through April 10 and has a projected error margin of 3.3 percent, found that 70 percent of those polled favored the designation of special smoking areas at work. Another 22 percent said smoking should be prohibited in the work place.",
