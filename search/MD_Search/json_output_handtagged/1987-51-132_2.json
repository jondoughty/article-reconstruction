    "article_text": "ASI has begun soliciting corporate sponsorships in order to bring quality programs to Cal Poly at less cost to the student. ASI controller Andy Higgins said the corporate sponsorships are a good deal for everyone. “Big companies find it tough to reach the college crowd,” he said, “so corporations are willing to do it (underwrite programs) to get in touch with the students.” What the sponsorships mean to students is more for their dollar, according to Higgins. “Student fees needn’t be raised to support programs,” he said. “We (ASI) might put out $10-15,000 for a program, but this way we put out around $800.” The most recent corporate-sponsored event at Cal Poly was the Coors Comedy Commandos. With Coors paying for the act and help- ing with promotions, Higgins said it cost students only $2 for the show. If ASI did everything, it would have had to charge students between $9 and $12. “We essentially made money on that event, rather than subsidizing it with student funds,” said Higgins. Another corporate-sponsored event was the spring quarter ASI film series, which was underwritten by General Motors. “General Motors got a plug on the promotional material,” said Higgins, “and they got a day to display some of their cars in the University Union.” Higgins said the biggest problem with corporate sponsorships is that ASI must avoid competing with the university for funds. “The administration is concerned if we’re soliciting businesses that aren’t our business to approach,” said Higgins, mentioning companies such as Hewlett-Packard that donate equipment and funds to universities. “There are some gray areas on who we can approach. We haven’t hammered out a formal policy yet.” Higgins added that ASI is picky about whc it gets for the sponsorships. “The company must have a good name,” he said. “The administration was concerned with Coors coming because of the alcohol issue, but it was very well done and they never once pushed drinking beer.” Higgins said that in the future corporate sponsorship will be a great way to bring top-notch speakers and entertainment to Cal Poly. “It can cost us up to $20,000 to put on some shows,” he said. “This way we minimize our risk, make some money and get good quality programs.”",
