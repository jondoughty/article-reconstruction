    "article_text": "From page 10 The 4-12 Mustangs continue CCAA play this weekend when they host Cal State Northridge and Cal State Los Angeles Friday and Saturday nights, respectively. Both games are scheduled for 7:30 p.m. in the Main 03rm. Going into the Brst weekend of CCAA play, NOTthridge was ranked No. 15 in ^ Division II poll. Versus Riverside, the Mustangs held All-everything Donna Hammond-Mares to 21 points and 11 rebotinds. Entering ths game, the talented Highlander senior was averaging 24.5 points and 13.6 rebounds. But, ac-coring to assistant coach Darla Wilson, itâ€™s not what Hammond-Mares did late in the game which hurt the Mustangs, itâ€™s what she didnâ€™t do-:foul out. â€œShe had four fouls in the second half and then didnâ€™t get anything else called on her the rest of the game,\" Wilson said. â€œAnd there were times when she could have fouled out. In the second half alone, itâ€™s ^amazing they took 20 free throws and we only had two. â€™Theyâ€™re not that clean of a team.â€ â€™The Highlanders were 15-of-20 from the line in the second half, the Mustangs, were one-for-two. For the game. Riverside was 23-for-30. Poly five-for-nine. Be that as it may, the Mustangs still had their chances in the second half to tie the game. They were within two a few times, but could never knot the scoft. We just didnâ€™t get the bucket we needed at the right time,â€ Wilson said. â€œI thought we did a good job on Hammond-Mares. We held her to 21 points and thatâ€™s a pretty shallow performance for her.â€ The Mustangs had five players score double figures. Ixeading the point production was Carolyn Crandall with 18. 'Kelly Ulrich â€¢ and Terrie MacDonald had 13 apiece, Michelle Harmeier added ' 12 and Nancy Hosken chip- ^ ped in 11. Hosken led the team with 13 rebounds. 'There wasnâ€™t a heck of a bt Poly could do against Pbmona. â€™The Broncos raised their record to 14-2. â€™niey are 1-0 in the CCAA. â€œPomona is the best Divisbn II team in the nation,â€ Wilson said. â€™The Bron^M shot 57 percent from the field (42-for-71). Thatâ€™s awesome. â€œIf there would have been a three-point line, Pomona would have made a dozen of them,â€ Wilson said. \"We were in Jackie Whiteâ€™s face all night and she hit jumpers from the sideline all night. You canâ€™t do a bt with that. We pushed as much as we could.â€ â€œWeâ€™re not in Urge numbers,â€ Wilson said of the Mustangs, who are now down to eight pbyers. Kathy Ferguson is out of actbn for at least three weeks because of a stress fracture in her right foot. â€œAnd everyone did expend themselves at Riverside bst night. I think that had a bt to do with our performance against Pomona.â€ Ulrich led ths Mustangsâ€™ in scoring against Pomona with 18. She also pulled in eight rebounds. 'Hiat tied Hosken for the team high. Harmeier had seven caroms, whib MacDonald and Alison Walker pulled in six apiece. Crandall had 14 points.",
