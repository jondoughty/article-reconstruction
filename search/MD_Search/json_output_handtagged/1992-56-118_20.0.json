    "article_text": "It might be considered sexist. Possibly blatantly so. Yet, to have the overwhelmingly urge to kneel down and kiss John Zimmerman’s ring finger must not be that unusual. Zimmerman holds the dubious record for photographing the most Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues. Seven times the photographer has visually knocked SI readers out with his array of shots depicting the smallest swimsuits on the world’s top female models. Zimmerman was on campus Saturday along with a handful of othe'* who’s who in photographers to watch — or take part in — a presentation opening Mark Kauffman’s art show titled “A Slice of Life.” Kauffman, Zimmerman and John Dominis, another photographer on hand Saturday, all have astonished people with their photojournalism for decades. Saturday was no exception. Speaking sports of course, the threesome have provided SI and Life readers rolls upon rolls of historic film of athletes and events. Kauffman will forever be remembered for shooting the first Sports Illustrated cover shot of the Milwaukee Braves’ Eddie Mathews at County Stadium in Milwaukee. Dominis, Si’s photo editor from 1979-82 and fellow Life photographer, showed his ensemble Saturday at the presentation. Among those was a black-and-white shot of Mickey Mantle at Yankee Stadium. Dominis told a standing-room-only crowd at Fisher Science room 286 that he was assigned to take photographs of the popular Yankee slugger during his later — and least productive — years. Dominis’ shot shows Mantle, against a backdrop of a sold out Yankee Stadium, throwing his batting helmet in disgust after an at-bat. “The one thing we did a lot (at Life) was to try to think up what would be a real interesting picture,” Dominis said afterwards. “Y)u want to give yourself a tough problem, instead of giving yourself an easy problem. Ybu can solve almost any problem if you struggle with it.” Dominis said that the creativity Life photographers yearned for, and provided readers time after time on a weekly basis before television appeared, was lost at Sports Illustrated. “At SI when I was the picture editor there, the one thing I didn’t ei\\joy too much about it was that they always had to have the news,” he said. “They had to have the main event. Which meant that you had to have a lot of photographers because you didn’t want to miss that one touchdown. So, it kind of stifles creativity. “For Life ... we would definitely try to not do the same thing. We would tiy to look for something else, some other angle.” SI also presents another problem to editors and photographers alike — the jinx. Both Domini s and Zimmerman discussed the mysterious, yet ongoing curse that fixates itself on an athlete that appears on Si’s front cover. “Oh, you heard about it all the time,” Dominis said. “Maybe it went to the guy’s head a little bit being on the cover of Sports Illustrated. And maybe it fouled him up a little bit... I suppose it’s possible. But, we never believed in it.” For some unknown reason, the spell has yet to affect models, Zimmerman said. “No never heard it on a girl, but on baseball players and football players. I mean (athletes) would not run away. But they were worried about it,” he said. “Athletes, but never beautiful girls. Because once the beautiful girl is on the cover, that means she immediately that year will get a contract with ... Revlon or big beauty companies that’s worth at least a.quarter of million dollars.” Zimmerman has photographed numerous other athletes and events athletes, including five Olympic games. Kauffman, who tossed out hilarious one-liners between presentations, seemed to wrap up Saturday’s event nicely afterwards. “Lot of history seen through those eyes.”",
