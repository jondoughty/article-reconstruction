    "article_text": "Black History Month is almost upon us once again. This is a time for all black Americans, and indeed all Americans, to salute the accomplishments of Afro-Americans\tpast\tand\tpresent. But why is this necessary? Why must this seemingly useless information\tbe\t“crammed\tdown our throats” every February? For those of you who may not understand, imagine your particular culture not having a heritage. What would it be like to be Italian, English, French, or anything\tfor\tthat\tmatter, without a sense of who you are and w here you came from? I can\tassure\tyou it is a feeling\tof\ttotal uselessness\tand\tembarassment. Where\tdo\tyou come from? Why should you be proud of who you are? These questions\tI’m\tsure\tmost\tpeople inter- nally ask themselves, and most can answer for themselves with almost no hesitation. Except the Afro-American. When Africans were sold into\tslavery\tand brought to North\tAmerica, they were\tcut off\tfrom the knowledge of\ttheir\town kind, cut off from the knowledge of their own language, religion and past culture until the African-American was the only race on earth that had absolutely no knowledge of its true identity. The African-American “Negro” was invented in this country by the frequent trips massa made to the slave quarters to cool down his burning libido. This weakening of the bond between the Negro of America and the African caused prejudice and hatred among this group that was enslaved as a whole. After several generations, when almost all that was African about the black man was either killed off or forgotten, massa began to teach his uncouth animals they did indeed come from Africa — where they were plucked from the jungle, swinging from vines like monkeys and killing tigers with their bare hands — and were saved from the uneducated, uncultured primitive societies of Africa. And when they wanted to worship God, they could not even think of worshipping a god in their likeness. God is black? Nonsense. Could never be. The black man eventually would do anything to be like the white man — bleach his skin, straighten his hair, lighten his eyes — because the white man was seen as superior to the black man. The sad part about all this is not only did whites feel this way, but many blacks felt the same way, too. Being lighter complexioned meant a black could “pass” for being white. Being black was a curse. When a young boy by the name of Malcolm Little, who later would become known to the world as Malcolm X, was in the eighth grade, a section on black history was introduced in his history class. He was discouraged to find the entire history of black Americans was exactly one paragraph long. The entire history of a people who had been in this country for more than 300 years was one paragraph. This experience has been shared by many blacks across the nation when they were young, including myself. Imagine the feeling that as a people your culture had accomplished nothing. Many Americans know nothing of the accomplishments of Louis Lattimer, Dr. Charles R. Drew, George Washington Carver and Benjamin Banneker. 1 know I never read, in a state-issued text, much more than a few pages of scribble about the accomplishments of these and other black Americans. Growing up without a sense of pride in who you are is difficult. Being denied access to the heritage of the black man, many blacks grow up thinking they are little more than what they saw on television just 10 years ago — television where blacks were portrayed as pimps, street whores and hustlers, killers and criminals. People — especially young, impressionable black and white youths — believe what is seen on television. Ignorance of peoples’ cultures is one problem of all Americans, We as a country are so ethnocentric we have created a Berlin Wall of sorts by not allowing others’ ideas to penetrate our little world. This “Berlin W'all” is even more opposing than the actual one in Germany was, for this wall is of the mind. Physical barriers are easy to overcome; mental barriers take much more of an earnest effort to rise above. So the purpose of Black History Month is not to force blackness onto everyone who might cross the path of a parade or speech, but to enhance the knowledge of a culture that was and still is denied to its people. In order for people to respect us, and indeed to respect ourselves, we must know who we are and where we come from. One month out of a year isn’t going to erase 371 years of denial, but it must start somewhere. And to my brothers and sisters. Black History Month for us must go on year-round, so we may continue to educate our unknowing brothers and sisters, and bring to them the light of knowledge, and a ray of hope for the future.",
