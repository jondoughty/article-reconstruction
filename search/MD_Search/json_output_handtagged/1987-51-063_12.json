    "article_text": "The two-time defending national champion Lady Broncos of Cal Poly Pomona expressed interest in a third straight crown on Saturday, rolling over the Lady Mustangs 90-62 in the Main Gym. After leading by 11 points at the half, the Lady Broncos came back to outscore the Lady Mustangs by 17 points in the second half, bringing them one step closer to their third straight NCAA title. Pomona, which leads the league in scoring with an average of 71 points, played way above average, while San Luis Obispo, second in the league in points averaged, played only a little better than normal. Mustang center Sherrie At-teberry, who leads the league in scoring with an average of 20.5 points per game, led the Lady Mustangs -in scoring Saturday with 22 points. Atteberry also led her team in free throws by making eight of 14, but said that a lot of missed shots cost them the game. “We missed a bunch of free throws and that pulled us out of the game and it was too hard to fight back,” she said. Starting guard Julie Jordan was second in scoring with 17 points, although she was playing with a bad case of the flu. Jordan commented, “We made a lot of mental errors that I think lost us the game. “I think if we had kept up with them and hadn’t made these mistakes, we would have been OK.” Mustang coach Jill Orrock called the loss a bit disappointing, but was still confident of a win against Pomona later on in the season. “The key,” said Orrock, “is that our five starters have to stay in the game and shoot well.” Orrock said that when playing the Lady Broncos her team has to take advantage of everything. “Against Pomona, you’ve got to take everything they give you,” she said. But the Lady Broncos were not giving anything the Lady Mustangs could use. The Mustangs had several players get into foul trouble trying to defense the potent Bronco attack, and by game’s end Jordan, Sherinne Barlow, Janet Jorgensen and Catherine Barlow had all fouled out. The loss of Barlow and Jorgensen was disastrous for the Mustangs, who are playing without academically ineligible freshman Trina Tualemosa. The forward was tied for first place in the league in shooting percentage, hitting at a .667 clip.",
