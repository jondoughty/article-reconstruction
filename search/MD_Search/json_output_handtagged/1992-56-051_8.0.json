    "article_text": "I think evaluating teachers could be either a positive or negative thing. In a positive manner, I just transferred into the English major and I have no idea which professors are real good and which ones aren’t. I think it can be a positive thing to get the most out of your education. From the negative aspect, I think students are obviously going to flock to the teachers they’ve heard are good. That will make the classes impacted and people are going to want to add those classes. Overall I think it’s a tough choice. I think evaluations should be made available to the students so we can pick our teacher, but since CAf*TURE makes it impossible anyway, I guess it all doesn’t really matter much anyway. It would be good to see them but I don’t think it would change much because classes are always full anyway. ASI government should be in charge of getting it together and getting them out to students. It seems like they don’t get much done. What do they do, anyway? I never see any results. I guess they get money from our tuition so they should do it. I would like to know what other students have to say about a teacher before I take them. A lot of times you don’t have the access or know someone that has taken a professor before and you’re faced with about four different teachers. An educated decision can make a difference in the course. If they’re well-thought-out evaluations, they could give the good and the bad about a teacher and give everyone a more educated choice. Not that through CAPTURE you can really choose anyway, but overall it’s a good idea. I think it’s fine. I’m in favor of it. I think students deserve to know more directly instead of through the grapevine what teachers are really like. They can get that through evaluations if they’re well done. The English department has a good evaluation form. Students find these things out anyway, don’t they? Why not just make it all available and eliminate the middleman. ASI or another student organization might be responsible, I would think. I think that we should definitely have instructor evaluations because it would help students make a choice that would improve their education. If they wanted a challenge they could take a difficult teacher. I don’t think hard teachers would be avoided because students basically want a good education. I read that commentary about it (Mustang Daily, Jan. 10) and there should definitely be a special publication. It should be done by a club on campus, possibly ASI — but definitely not administrators. It would be a good reference for incoming freshmen — they could get a basic student opinion. I think it’s a great idea because there are a lot of great teachers out there with a lot to offer. There are a lot of great teachers out there. If recommendations were let out, you could take their class without having to worry what kind of professor you’re going to get. It’s a great idea because overall, it would keep education at a higher level. Better teachers would be recognized for their abilities and would get fuller classes. Students have to take the teachers so they should be able to see all the opinions of the teacher. At the present time, compiled student evaluations of Cal Poly faculty are not made available to the student body. All faculty members are required to be evaluated periodically. Non-tenured faculty are evaluated more often and the evaluations can have an effect on their permanence at Cal Poly. The eSU system allow schools to choose evaluation styles Individually. Many faculty feel that evaluations are only for the guidance of the Instructor. Several years ago, Associated Students Inc. brought the idea of a student evaluation team to the faculty. The evaluations would have been available to all students in the library. The idea was rejected.",
