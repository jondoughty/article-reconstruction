    "article_text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP)\t— A\tfederal magistrate, denying bail to the alleged kingpin of Oakland narcotics, told a hearing Tuesday he would be “an imbecile’’ to disregard the record of 20-year-old Darryl Reed and the circumstances of his arrest. “I can’t take the risk ... it’s too big a risk,’’ to fix bail, said U.S. Magistrate Wayne Brazil at a detention hearing for Reed, arrested\tDec. 8 allegedly while in the act of “cooking up’’ 30.4 pounds of rock cocaine in an apartment. Officers reported seizing items including coke, crack, various packagings, $60,000 in cash and a .4S-caIiber automatic. Reed was charged with possession of cocaine for sale, possession and con-piracy to make and sell crack, and the weapons count. The drugs alone, including around IS pounds of cocaine hydrochloride, were worth $3 million. police have said. Reed allegedly had cocaine dust on his hands and was carrying a big metal soup pot from the stove to the kitchen sink when police broke down the apartment door. On conviction he could draw a minimum of 15 years in prison and a maximum of life imprisonment. He has pleaded innocent. At the time of the arrest, Reed had five months left of probation on a prior weapons conviction. Brazil ordered Reed to appear in U.S. District Court Feb. 8. The seizure was the biggest such crack haul “in the history of the United States,’’ Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Dondero told the court in arguing against bail for Reed. Narcotics officers have described Reed as the drug dealer who “supplies all the other cocaine dealers” in Oakland, and markets “a minimum of 50 pounds a week.”",
