    "article_text": "There he was. Ed McMahon was smiling at me from my mailbox. Nevermind how he got all 200-plus pounds of himself in that breadbox-sized container. But there he was, telling me I may already have won millions of dollars of VALUABLE PRIZES. But that wasn’t all. Also in that batch of mail I received correspondence from a lesser-known but no less prestigious organization: “Yes, you, SUSAN JANE EDMONDSON of SAN LUIS OBISPO, CALIFORNIA have won one of these VALUABLE PRIZES:\ta 1987 Cadillac El Dorado; an A-frame home on the shore of South Lake Tahoe; a trip for two to London, Paris, Venice and Rome; $250,000 cash; or a priceless mystic Oriental gemstone. Drive now. to our warehouse in Tulare to see which prize has your name on it.” I think it may be the gemstone. Some people may complain about the reams of junk mail which circulate through their mailbox, yet they are lucky. At least this mail is rather harmless, full of flattery, and has the remote possibility of awarding riches and changing lives forever. But when you’re an editor of a newspaper the mail you receive takes on a different tone. You see, strange people in strange places such as Oregon and Utah actually believe Mustang Daily to be their Mouthpiece to the World. And we’re talking serious threats involved here. Case in point: “Editor: I want my letter of Sept. 4, on the Pharoah, published in the next issue of your school newspaper. To not publish it will guarantee that you and whoever else voted against it will be forever reincarnated in a lower order of life, meaning that you’ll never again be in a human body.” Now that’s not too bad. I’ve always wanted to be a squirrel. Then there are the frequent messages from Maple Heights, Ohio, which always begin, “As Almighty GOD, I greet you.” Now this raises a few questions in my mind. One, is there a God? Two, why is He in Ohio? Three, why is He writing to Mustang Daily instead of ending world hunger? Four, did He really tell Oral Roberts that He is going to “take him” in February? And five, if Oral Roberts is taken does that mean that he will end up in Ohio also? But the true reason I tell you all of this, kindly reader, is to warn you. On Jan. 17 1 received a letter from a Mr. Johnson in San Diego, who warned, “I am sending this letter only to the large universities for them to publish. I cannot predict the day nor hour, but only the period I believe with all my heart the quake will come in. The basis of my prediction is in the stars, as interpreted with Astrology in conjunction with my work. The period is from Jan. 23 through Feb. 1, 1987. Good luck.” There you have it. My only advice to you is to take shelter in open doorways. Don’t run around screaming like Shelley Winters. As for me, I think I’ll just donate $1,000 to Oral Roberts and pray for an afterlife with lots of acorns and a warm tree in which to sleep.",
